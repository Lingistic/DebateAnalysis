Speaker	Statement	Democrat	GOP	Debate Number
WEBB	Thank you.  You know, people are disgusted with the way that money has corrupted our political process, intimidating incumbents and empowering Wall Street every day, the turnstile government that we see, and also the power of the financial sector in both parties.  They're looking for a leader who understands how the system works, who has not been coopted by it, and also has a proven record of accomplishing different things. I have a record of working across the political aisle. I've also spent more than half of my professional life away from politics in the independent world of being an author, a journalist, and a sole proprietor.  In government service, I've fought and bled for our country in Vietnam as a Marine. I spent years as Assistant Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy — in the Reagan administration.  In the senate, I spoke about economic fairness and social justice from day one. I also wrote and passed the best piece of veterans education legislation in history, the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill. I brought criminal justice reform out of the political shadows and into the national discussion. I led what later became called the Strategic Pivot to Asia two years before President Obama was elected.  I know where my loyalties are.  My mother grew up in the poverty of east Arkansas chopping cotton, picking strawberries. Three of her seven siblings died in childhood. My wife, Hong, came to this country as a refugee from war torn Vietnam — learned English, a language that was not spoken at home, and earned her way into Cornell Law School. I have five daughters. Amy works with disabled veterans, Sarah is an emergency room nurse, Julia is a massage therapist, Emily and Georgia are still in school. My son Jim fought as an infantry Marine on the bloody streets of Ramadi.  You may be sure that in a Webb administration, the highest priority will be the working people who every day go out and make this country stronger at home, and who give us the right reputation and security overseas under a common sense foreign policy. [cheering and applause]  	True	False	1
WEBB	"No, actually I believe that I am where the Democratic Party traditionally has been. The Democratic Party, and the reason I've decided to run as a Democrat, has been the party that gives people who otherwise have no voice in the corridors of power a voice. And that is not determined by race.  And as a clarification, I have always supported affirmative action for African Americans. That's the way the program was originally designed because of their unique history in this country, with slavery and the Jim Crow laws that followed. What I have discussed a number of times is the idea that when we create diversity programs that include everyone, quote, ""of color,"" other than whites, struggling whites like the families in the Appalachian mountains, we're not being true to the Democratic Party principle of elevating the level of consciousness among our people about the hardships that a lot of people who happen to be have — by culture, by the way.  "	True	False	1
WEBB	Look, there are two fundamental issues that are involved in this discussion. We need to pay respect to both of them. The first is the issue of who should be kept from having guns and using firearms. And we have done not a good job on that.  A lot of them are criminals. And a lot of the people are getting killed are members of gangs inside our urban areas. And a lot of them are mentally incapacitated. And the shooting in Virginia Tech in '07, this individual had received medical care for mental illness from three different professionals who were not allowed to share the information.  So we do need background checks. We need to keep the people who should not have guns away from them. But we have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.  	True	False	1
WEBB	May I? People are going back and forth here for 10 minutes here. There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The average American does not have that, and deserves the right to be able to protect their family.  	True	False	1
WEBB	Anderson, can I come into this discussion at some point?  	True	False	1
WEBB	Thank you. I've been standing over here for about ten minutes, trying.  	True	False	1
WEBB	It's just — it's gone back and forth over there.  	True	False	1
WEBB	You got the lucky [inaudible].  	True	False	1
WEBB	Look, let's start — I've been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes — let's start with why Russia is in Syria right now. There are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur. The first was the invasion of Iraq, which destabilized ethnic elements in Iraq and empowered Iran. The second was the Arab Spring, which created huge vacuums in Libya and in Syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there. And the third was the recent deal allowing Iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signals, bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in Iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world.  Now, I say this as someone who spent five years in the Pentagon and who opposed the war in Iraq, whose son fought in Iraq, I've fought in Vietnam. But if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy, a focus, the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with China. And we need to do this because of their aggression in the region. We need to do it because of the way they treat their own people.  	True	False	1
WEBB	And I would say this. I've been waiting for 10 minutes. I will say this.  	True	False	1
WEBB	I will — well, you've let a lot of people go over their time. I would say this...  	True	False	1
WEBB	... to the unelected, authoritarian government of China: You do not own the South China Sea. You do not have the right to conduct cyber warfare against tens of millions of American citizens. And in a Webb administration, we will do something about that.  	True	False	1
WEBB	Can I...  [crosstalk]  O'MALLEY: Anderson, I think we are learning...  [crosstalk]  O'MALLEY: Anderson, I think there's lessons to be learned from Benghazi. And those lessons are that we need to do a much better job as a nation of having human intelligence on the ground so that we know who the emerging next generation leaders are that are coming up to replace a dictator when his time on this planet ends.  And I believe that's what Chris Stevens was trying to do. But he did not have the tools. We have failed as a country to invest in the human intelligence that would allow us to make not only better decisions in Libya, but better decisions in Syria today.  And it's a huge national security failing.  	True	False	1
WEBB	Thank you.  [crosstalk]  	True	False	1
WEBB	This is not about Benghazi per se. To me it is the inevitability of something like Benghazi occurring in the way that we intervened in Libya. We had no treaties at risk. We had no Americans at risk. There was no threat of attack or imminent attack.  There is plenty of time for a president to come to the Congress and request authority to use military force in that situation. I called for it on the Senate floor again and again. I called for it in Senate hearings.  It is not a wise thing to do. And if people think it was a wise thing to do, try to get to the Tripoli airport today. You can't do it.  	True	False	1
WEBB	Everybody makes their decisions when the time there is conscription. And as long as they go through the legal process that our country requires, I respect that. And it would be for the voters to decide whether Senator Sanders or anyone else should be president.  I will say this, coming from the position that I've come from, from a military family, with my brother a marine, my son was a marine in Iraq, I served as a marine, spending five years in the Pentagon, I am comfortable that I am the most qualified person standing up here today to be your commander-in-chief.  	True	False	1
WEBB	I believe that the signal that we sent to the region when the Iran nuclear deal was concluded was that we are accepting Iran's greater position on this very important balance of power, among our greatest ally Israel, and the Sunnis represented by the Saudi regime, and Iran. It was a position of weakness and I think it encouraged the acts that we've seen in the past several weeks.  	True	False	1
WEBB	Our greatest long-term strategic challenge is our relation with China. Our greatest day-to-day threat is cyber warfare against this country. Our greatest military-operational threat is resolving the situations in the Middle East.  	True	False	1
WEBB	I hope I can get that kind of time here. As a President of the United States, every life in this country matters. At the same time, I believe I can say to you, I have had a long history of working with the situation of African Americans.  We're talking about criminal justice reform, I risked my political life raising the issue of criminal justice reform when I ran for the Senate in Virginia in 2006. I had democratic party political consultants telling me I was committing political suicide.  We led that issue in the congress. We started a national debate on it. And it wasn't until then that the Republican Party started joining in.  I also represented a so-called war criminal, an African American Marine who was wounded — who was convicted of murder in Vietnam, for six years. He took his life three years into this. I cleared his name after — after three years.  	True	False	1
WEBB	And I put the African American soldier on the Mall. I made that recommendation and fought for it. So, if you want someone who is — can stand up in front of you right now and say I have done the hard job, I have taken the risks, I am your person.  	True	False	1
WEBB	Bernie, say my name so I can get into this.  	True	False	1
WEBB	OK. Thank you. [laughter]  	True	False	1
WEBB	Anderson, I need to jump in (inaudible).  	True	False	1
WEBB	There is a reality that I think we all need to recognize with respect to the power of the financial sector.  And let me just go back a minute and say that on this TARP program, I introduced a piece of legislation calling for a windfall profits tax on the executives of any of these companies that got more than $5 billion, that it was time for them, once they got their compensation and their bonus, to split the rest of the money they made with the nurses and the truck drivers and the soldiers who bailed them out. With respect to the financial sector, I mean, I know that my time has run out but in speaking of changing positions and the position on how this debate has occurred is kind of frustrating because unless somebody mentions my name I can't get into the discussion.  	True	False	1
WEBB	All right. Well, I'm trying to set a mark here so maybe we can get into a little more later on. This hasn't been equal time.  But if you want to look at what has happened, if we look at the facts in terms of how we're going to deal with this, since that crash, in the last 10 years, the amount of the world's capital economy that Wall Street manages has gone from 44 percent to 55 percent.  That means the Wall Street money managers are not risking themselves as the same way the American people are when they're going to get their compensation. They're managing money from all over the world.  We have to take that into consideration when we're looking at ways to regulate it.  	True	False	1
WEBB	I wouldn't have a problem with that. Let me start by saying my wife is an immigrant. She was a refugee, her family escaped from Vietnam on a boat-- her entire extended family, after the communists took over, when hundreds of thousands of people were out there and thousands of them were dying. Went to two refugee camps, she never spoke English in her home, and she ended, as I said, graduating from Cornell Law School. That's not only American dream, that's a value that we have with a good immigration system in place. No country has — is a country without defining its borders. We need to resolve this issue. I actually introduced an amendment in the 2007 immigration bill...  	True	False	1
WEBB	...Giving a pathway to citizenship to those people who had come here, and put down their roots, and met as a series of standards...  	True	False	1
WEBB	...lost (ph) — I introduced that in 2007 — We need a comprehensive reform, and we need to be able to define our borders.  	True	False	1
WEBB	"I — well, I — I would leave his ultimate judgment to the legal system. Here's what I do believe. We have a serious problem in terms of the collection of personal information in this country. And one of the things that I did during the FISA bill in 2007, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, was introduce with Russ Feingold two amendments basically saying, ""We understand the realities of how you have to collect this broad information in the Internet age, but after a certain period of time, you need to destroy the personal information that you have if people have not been brought — if criminal justice proceedings have not been brought against them.""  We've got a vast data bank of information that is ripe for people with bad intentions to be able to use. And they need to be destroyed.  "	True	False	1
WEBB	I got a great deal of admiration and affection for Senator Sanders, but I — Bernie, I don't think the revolution's going to come. And I don't think the Congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff. And if there would be a major difference between my administration and the Obama administration, it would be in the use of executive authority.  I came up as a committee counsel in the Congress, used to put dozens of bills through the House floor every year as a committee counsel on the Veterans Committee. I have a very strong feeling about how our federal system works and how we need to lead and energize the congressional process instead of allowing these divisions to continue to paralyze what we're doing. So I would lead — working with both parties in the Congress and working through them in the traditional way that our Constitution sets (ph).  	True	False	1
WEBB	Well, the — the question really is how are we going to solve energy problems here and in the global environment if you really want to address climate change?  And when I was in the Senate, I was an all-of-the-above energy voter. We introduced legislation to bring in alternate energy as well as nuclear power. I'm a strong proponent of nuclear power. It is safe, it is clean. And really, we are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here.  We've done a good job in this country since 1970. If you look at China and India, they're the greatest polluters in the world. Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in one of those two countries. We need to solve this in a global way. It's a global problem and I have been very strong on — on doing that. The — the agreements — the so-called agreements that we have had with China are illusory in terms of the immediate requirements of the — of the Chinese government itself.  So let's solve this problem in an international way, and then we really will have a — a way to address climate change.  	True	False	1
WEBB	I'd have to say the enemy soldier that threw the grenade that wounded me, but he's not around right now to talk to.  	True	False	1
WEBB	Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, it's been a pleasure to be with you tonight. You've heard a lot of promises up here; you've heard a lot of rhetoric. They all seem to happen during campaigns, and then once the election's over, people start from scratch again and try to get things done.  One of the things I can promise you, if you look at my record, in and out of government, is that I've always been willing to take on a complicated, something unpopular issues, and work them through, the complex issues, and work them through in order to have the solution.  We did it with criminal justice reform. We've had a lot of discussion here about criminal justice reform. We did it in other ways. We need a national political strategy for our economy, for our social policy, for social justice, and, by the way, for how you run and manage the most complex bureaucracy in the world, which is the federal government.  I know how to lead. I did it in Vietnam, I did it in the Pentagon, I did it in the Senate, and if you will help me overcome this cavalcade of — of financial irregularities and money that is poisoning our political process, I am ready to do that for you in the White House.  	True	False	1
CRAMER	Dr. Carson, in recent weeks, a number of pharmaceutical companies has been accused of profiteering, for dramatically raising the prices of life-saving drugs. You have spent a lifetime in medicine.  Have these companies gone too far? Should the government be involved in controlling some of these price increases?  	False	True	3
CRAMER	Thank you, Dr. Carson.  Governor Christie, there has been a lot of political rhetoric that some bank executives should have gone to jail for the 2008 financial crisis.  But General Motors paid more than $1 billion in fines and settlements for its ignition switch defect. One hundred and twenty- four people died as a result of these faulty switches. No one went to jail.  As a former prosecutor, do you believe the people responsible for the switch and the cover-up belong behind bars?  	False	True	3
CRAMER	Thank you, Governor Christie.  	False	True	3
PERRY	I will tell you one thing: I would whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry. Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.  But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but hell no, to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror...  [video clip ends]  [video clip begins]  	False	True	1
LEMON	Alright, Anderson, thank you very much. I'm not sure how to follow that, but this question is about something that has tripped some of the candidates up out on the campaign trail. Can you hear me?  Can't hear me in the room. OK, here we go again, as I said...  	True	False	1
LEMON	...There we go...  	True	False	1
LEMON	All right. This one is for Martin O'Malley. Anderson, Governor O'Malley, this is from Anna Bettis from Tempe, Arizona. Here it is.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  	True	False	1
LEMON	So, Governor O'Malley, please tell Anna how you would protect the environment better than all the other candidates up on that stage.  O'MALLEY: Yeah.  Anna, I have put forward a plan — and I'm the only candidate, I believe, in either party to do this — to move America forward to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050.  We did not land a man on the moon with an all-of-the-above strategy. It was an intentional engineering challenge, and we solved it as a nation. And our nation must solve this one.  So I put forward the plan that would extend the investor tax credits for solar and for wind. If you go across Iowa, you see that 30 percent of their energy now comes from wind. We're here in Las Vegas, one of the most sustainable cities in America, doing important things in terms of green building, architecture and design.  We can get there as a nation, but it's going to require presidential leadership. And as president, I intend to sign as my very first order in office the — an order that moves us as a nation and dedicates our resources to solving this problem and moving us to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050.  	True	False	1
LEMON	"Alright, Anderson. This is for Senator Sanders, OK? This is from Carrie (ph) Kang (ph) from Manassas, Virginia, would like would like to ask the Senator, ""President Obama has had a difficult time getting Republicans to compromise on just about every agenda. How will you approach this going forward, and will it be any different?""  Senator?  "	True	False	1
RADDATZ	Questions of leadership and character have dominated the news ever since the Iowa caucuses a few days ago. Here with us to question the candidates this evening are Josh McElveen from WMUR here in Manchester and author and commentator Mary Katherine Ham.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Dr. Ben Carson. [applause]  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Businessman Donald Trump. [applause]  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Former Florida Governor, Jeb Bush. [applause]  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Ladies and gentlemen, the Republican candidates. [applause]  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	And Donald Trump. [applause]  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	The applause so loud you couldn't hear. We couldn't hear, either. That's a good sign for the excitement this evening.  Gentlemen, thank you for being here tonight, just days before voters here in New Hampshire make their decisions. The rules are simple and have been agreed to by all the campaigns. There will be 60 seconds to answer and if another candidate is mentioned in that answer, that candidate will have 30 seconds to respond. There are green, yellow and red lights that each candidate will see to signal when time is up and they will also hear this sound.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Senator Cruz, you are a first term Senator as well. Your opponents say you, like Senator Rubio, are not prepared to be Commander in Chief. You have talked tough about threats we face in the Mid-East. It was reported just moments ago that the North Koreans test launched an intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea has nuclear weapons, and conducted another nuclear test just last month.  The missile that was launched is the kind the North Koreans hope could someday carry a nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States. How would you respond if Commander in Chief to that launch?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Well, let me ask you this, if you were Commander in Chief tonight would you have order the U.S. military to destroy that missile preemptively on the launchpad to prevent North Korea from becoming an even graver threat?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	... Senator Cruz, let me tell you this, you have talked tough about the Mid-East, you haven't gotten those intelligence briefings about that. Why not tell us whether you would preemptively strike a missile on a launchpad that threatens the U.S...  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Okay. Senator Cruz, I will say that missile has been sitting there for quite some time, and they have had eyes on it.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Senator Rubio, I'm talking about a preemptive strike on the launch pad.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	OK. Thank you, Senator Rubio.  Governor Kasich, how would you respond to tonight's launch?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Thank you, Governor Kasich. Thank you — thank you...  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	... Governor Bush, I'll get to you in a moment.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Thank you, Governor Bush.  Mr. Trump, do you have a red line with North Korea? Would you consider military action? And how far would you let them go?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	And I'd like him to finish the question, please.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Specific — as to North Korea.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Senator Rubio, you were mentioned. [applause]  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Thank you very much, Senator Rubio.  Governor Bush, another problem facing the commander-in-chief right now is that North Korea is currently detaining an American college student. What would you do to get that college student back home?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Governor Christie, I want to go to you on the same question. [applause]  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Would you negotiate with North Korea to...  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Thank you very much, Governor Christie. [applause]  David?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	"Senator Cruz, to that point, Mr. Trump has said that your position on health care means that maybe you've got, quote, ""no heart"". There is a question here, though, about uncovered folks. You suggested repealing and replacing Obamacare. As we learned with President Obama's broken promise that everyone could keep their plan, any major plan — change in health care policy carries with it the risk that some people will lose their insurance coverage or have to change it.  How do you reassure that those people that repealing and replacing Obamacare is still in their best interest?  "	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Senator Cruz, you advocate what you call carpet bombing, or saturation bombing, to defeat ISIS, citing the more than 1,100 air attacks that the U.S. carried out during the first Gulf War in 1991.  Explain how a strategy to defeat a standing army would work against an unconventional terrorist group that is now hiding amongst the population.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Senator Cruz, would you like to expand or loosen the rules of engagement? I was just over in a command center in Erbil and they said they thought the rules of engagement worked. Because you have so many civilians in those populated areas, they don't want to hit civilians.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	So, loosen the rules of engagement?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Senator Rubio, you said in the last debate that ISIS is the most dangerous, jihadist group in the history of mankind And that will it take overwhelming U.S. force to defeat them. Can you specifically tell us what you mean by overwhelming force?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Again, Senator Rubio, you've already said ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind. So, that would make it more dangerous than Al Qaida, the insurgents we fought in Iraq. We committed hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops to fight those groups. So if ISIS is the most dangerous group in history, why not commit a large U.S. ground force?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Well, what would you do — what would you do differently to try to get those Sunni forces? They have not been coming forward.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	"Mr. Trump — thank you very much, Senator Rubio. Mr. Trump. [applause]  You have said you will vigorously bomb ISIS. You've said, ""we've got to get rid of ISIS, quickly, quickly."" How would you get rid of them so quickly? And please give us specifics.  "	False	True	8
RADDATZ	And — and what would you do in those cities, where there are people who we are trying to help, who ISIS is essentially holding hostage?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Thank you very much, Mr. Trump. [applause]  Let's turn to Libya. Governor Bush, it is a country in chaos. There is no government. This week, defense officials said there are now 5,000 ISIS fighters there, roughly doubling previous estimates. We know you and others have been critical of the administration's handling of Libya after the initial air strikes that you supported.  But this is a problem you would stand to inherit if you're the next president. Reports this week said the administration is considering new air strikes, possible special operations raids. Would you support renewed air strikes or any U.S. involvement on the ground?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Thank you very much, Governor Bush. Dr. Carson?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	And would you support renewed airstrikes?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	We're going to move on.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Thank you, Governor Christie. Thank you, Josh.  Our partner in this debate, the Independent Journal Review, has collected questions from some prominent conservatives around the country.  Here's a videotaped question from radio host Larry O'Connor.  [begin video clip]  O'CONNOR: In 2008, we saw how motivated an electorate can be when they think their vote is making history. Let's face it: if Hillary Clinton is the nominee for the Democrats, you'll be running against the prospect of the first woman president.  How will you change that narrative and motivate the electorate behind your candidacy?  [end video clip]  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, I'm going to give that question to you. You took it — you took it away anyway.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Thank you, Mr. Trump.  I'm going to go to Senator Rubio on this. How would you change that narrative?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Thank you, Senator Rubio. Dr. Carson, I want to go to you on Larry O' Connor's question. Would you change the narrative?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Yes.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Thank you very much Dr. Carson. I'm going to go back to David.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Governor Christie, earlier this week, the World Health Organization declared the Zika virus a global emergency. The same kind of mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus in Latin America are found here in the United States, and the virus has been linked to severe birth defects.  Governor Christie, at the peak of the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, you ordered an American nurse who landed at Newark Airport be detained and quarantined. As fear spreads now of the Zika virus and with the Rio Olympics just months away, is there a scenario where you would quarantine people traveling back from Brazil to prevent the spread in the United States?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Governor Christie, thank you. [applause]  I'm going to move to Dr. Carson, and go back to the Zika virus, is that going too far, quarantining? You're a doctor, what would you do?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Thanks very much, Dr. Carson.  I want to move on to the military. Senator Rubio, all restrictions on women in combat as long as they qualify. Positions including special operations forces, like Navy Seals. Just this week military leaders of the Army and Marine Corps said that they believed young women, just as young men are required to do, should sign up for Selective Service in case the Draft is reinstated.  Many of you have young daughters. Senator Rubio, should young women be required to sign up for Selective Service in case of a national emergency?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Thank you, Senator Rubio. Governor Bush, do you believe that young women...  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Do you believe young women should sign up for Selective Service, be required to sign up...  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Tell me what you'd say to American people out there...[applause]...who are sitting at home, who have daughters, who might worry about those answers, and might worry...  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	... if the Draft is reinstituted?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	... Are you saying you'd do away with it?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	You register for the draft.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	If it's reinstituted.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Thank you very much.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Thank you very much, Governor Christie.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	We just covered — wait one second, Dr. Carson.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Very quickly.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Thank you very much for bringing up that subject, Dr. Carson, of our veterans.  And for another question about our veterans, we go back to Josh McElveen from WMUR. Josh?  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Governor Christie.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Dr. Carson.  	False	True	8
RADDATZ	Senator Cruz.  	False	True	8
ANNOUNCER	Hello from MinuteEarth. Fossil fuels have long kept our cars moving and our light bulbs lit.  But we know that burning these fuels releases heat-trapping gases that are warming the planet, causing seas to rise and contributing to extreme weather events, like South Carolina's devastating flooding last year.  Fighting human-caused climate change means giving up our global addiction to fossil fuels and shifting the bulk of the world's energy supply to alternative sources.  Some countries have acted decisively to make this transition. But here at home, we still get a whooping 82 percent of our energy from coal, oil, and natural gas.  In the U.S., political gridlock, pressure from industry lobbyists and insufficient R&D have made an already tough battle against climate change even tougher.  [end video clip]  	True	False	4

CORDES	John, thanks so much.  We've learned a lot during the course of this campaign about the things that you'd like to do that you say would help the middle class, but we haven't heard quite as much about who would pick up the tab.  So Secretary Clinton, first to you. You want to cap individuals' prescription drug costs at $250 a month. You want to make public college debt-free. You want community college to be free altogether. And you want mandatory paid family leave. So who pays for all that? Is it employers? Is it the taxpayers, and which taxpayers?  	True	False	2
CORDES	But a quick follow-up on that $250-a-month cap. Wouldn't the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies just pass that cost on to the consumers in the form of higher premiums?  	True	False	2
CORDES	Governor O'Malley, you also want to make public college debt-free. You want...  O'MALLEY: That's right.  	True	False	2
CORDES	... states to freeze tuition. You've got your own family leave plan. How would you pay for it? In Maryland, you raised the sales tax, you raised the gas tax and you raised taxes on families making over $150,000 a year. Is that the blueprint?  O'MALLEY: Nancy, the blueprint in Maryland that we followed was yes, we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment. And yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions.  So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating, but the highest median income in America. I believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains.  I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil. And if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.  	True	False	2
CORDES	Senator Sanders, you want to make public college free altogether. You want to increase Social Security benefits and you want to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure. So you said that to do some of these things, you'll impose a tax on top earners. How high would their rate go in a Sanders administration?  	True	False	2
CORDES	But let's get specific. How high would you go? You have said before you would go above 50 percent.  How high?  	True	False	2
CORDES	Secretary Clinton, Americans say that health care costs and wages are their top financial concerns. And health care deductibles, alone, have risen 67 percent over the past five years.  Is this something that Obamacare was designed to address? And if not, why not?  	True	False	2
CORDES	It is -- it is a worthy debate. Senator Sanders, a quick response, and then we'll get into health care again later.  	True	False	2
CORDES	"There was a lot of conversation on twitter about guns, but also about your conversation on campaign finance.  And Secretary Clinton, one of the tweets we saw said this, ""I've never seen a candidate invoke 9/11 to justify millions of Wall Street donations until now."" The idea being, yes, you were a champion of the community after 9/11, but what does that have to do with taking big donations?  "	True	False	2
CORDES	Hold on.  O'MALLEY: John, I think somewhere between...  	True	False	2
CORDES	Senator Sanders -- I'm sorry. Senator Sanders, but what is it in Secretary Clinton's record that shows you that she's been influenced by those donations?  [crosstalk]  	True	False	2
CORDES	Back to health care, by popular demand. First to you, Senator Sanders.  You'd prefer to scrap Obamacare and move to a single-payer system, essentially Medicare for all.  You say you want to put the private insurance companies out of business. Is it realistic to think that you can pull the plug on a $1 trillion industry?  	True	False	2
CORDES	Secretary Clinton, back in -- Secretary Clinton, back in 1994, you said that momentum for a single-payer system would sweep the country. That sounds Sanders-esque. But you don't feel that way anymore, why not?  	True	False	2
QUICK	Dr. Carson, let's talk about taxes.  You have a flat tax plan of 10 percent flat taxes, and -- I've looked at it -- and this is something that is very appealing to a lot of voters, but I've had a really tough time trying to make the math work on this.  If you were to took a 10 percent tax, with the numbers right now in total personal income, you're gonna come in with bring in $1.5 trillion. That is less than half of what we bring in right now. And by the way, it's gonna leave us in a $2 trillion hole.  So what analysis got you to the point where you think this will work?  	False	True	3
QUICK	I -- I understand that, but if you -- if you look at the numbers you probably have to get to 28.  	False	True	3
QUICK	15 percent still leaves you with a $1.1 trillion hole.  	False	True	3
QUICK	You'd have to cut -- you'd have to cut government about 40 percent to make it work with a $1.1 trillion hole.  	False	True	3
QUICK	That is true, I looked at the numbers.  	False	True	3
QUICK	Dr. Carson, thank you.  	False	True	3
QUICK	Governor...  	False	True	3
QUICK	Dr. Carson, let me get 30 seconds with Dr. Carson...  (CROSSTALK)  	False	True	3
QUICK	Thank you.  	False	True	3
QUICK	Senator -- Senator, thank you.  	False	True	3
QUICK	Gentlemen, I'm sorry, we need to...  (CROSSTALK)  	False	True	3
QUICK	We're going to move on.  	False	True	3
QUICK	Thirty seconds.  	False	True	3
QUICK	We'll get to everyone.  Ms. Fiorina, I -- I'd like to ask you a question. You are running for president of the United States because of your record running Hewlett-Packard. But the stock market is usually a fair indicator of the performance of a CEO, and the market was not kind to you.  Someone who invested a dollar in your company the day you took office had lost half of the dollar by the day you left. Obviously, you've talked in the past about what a difficult time it was for technology companies, but anybody who was following the market knows that your stock was a much worse performer, if you looked at your competitors, if you looked at the overall market.  I just wonder, in terms of all of that -- you know, we look back, your board fired you. I just wondered why you think we should hire you now.  	False	True	3
QUICK	"Mrs. Fiorina, it's interesting that you bring up Mr. Perkins, because...  (APPLAUSE) ...he said a lot of very questionable things. Last year, in an interview, he said that he thinks wealthy people should get more votes than poor people.  I think his quote was that, ""if you pay zero dollars in taxes, you should get zero votes. If you pay a million dollars, you should get a million votes."" Is this the type of person you want defending you?  "	False	True	3
QUICK	Mrs. Fiorina.  	False	True	3
QUICK	Thank you, we're out of time. Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina.  Carl.  	False	True	3
QUICK	Governor Christie, I'd like to (inaudible) a question next. Actually, I have a question for you (inaudible).  In your tell it like it is campaign, you've said a lot of tough things. You've said that we need to raise the retirement age for Social Security. You think that we need to cut benefits for people who make over $80,000 and eliminate them entirely for seniors who are making over $200,000.  Governor Huckabee, who is here on the stage, has said that you and others who think this way are trying to rob seniors of the benefits that they've earned. It raises the question: When it is acceptable to break a social compact?  	False	True	3
QUICK	...Governor...  	False	True	3
QUICK	...Thank you.  	False	True	3
QUICK	Welcome back to the presidential debate for the Republicans. We are live in Boulder, Colorado, right here on CNBC.  Folks, we'll get right back into this.  Mr. Trump, let's talk a little bit about bankruptcies. Your Atlantic City casinos filed for bankruptcy four times. In fact, Fitch, the ratings agency, even said that they were serial filers for all of this. You said that you did great with Atlantic City, and you did. But some of the individuals -- the bondholders, some of the contractors who worked for you, didn't fare so well.  Bankruptcy is a broken promise. Why should the voters believe the promises that you're telling them right now?  	False	True	3
QUICK	Mr. Trump, thank you.  	False	True	3
QUICK	Senator, I understand all of that. I had a lot of student loans when I got out, too. But you've had a windfall that a lot of Americans haven't. You made over a million dollars on a book deal, and some of these problems came after that.  	False	True	3
QUICK	But you -- but you liquidated that retirement account after the fact, and that cost you about $24,000 out of that in taxes and feed. That -- that was after you'd already come into that windfall. That's why I raised the question.  	False	True	3
QUICK	Yes, thank you John.  Senator Cruz, working women in this country still earn just 77 percent of what men earn. And I know that you've said you've been very sympathetic to our cause. But you've also you said that the Democrats' moves to try and change this are the political show votes.  I just wonder what you would do as President to try and help in this cause?  	False	True	3
QUICK	Mrs. Fiorina --  	False	True	3
QUICK	Mrs. Fiorina, we will come back to you.  	False	True	3
QUICK	Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina. Carl?  (APPLAUSE)  	False	True	3
QUICK	Mr. Trump, let's stay on this issue of immigration. You have been very critical of Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook who has wanted to increase the number of these H1Bs.  	False	True	3
QUICK	So you're in favor of...  (CROSSTALK)  	False	True	3
QUICK	You know, Mr. -- you know, Mr. Trump, if I may (inaudible). You've been -- you have been -- you had talked a little bit about Marco Rubio. I think you called him Mark Zuckerberg's personal senator because he was in favor of the H1B.  	False	True	3
QUICK	So this was an erroneous article the whole way around?  	False	True	3
QUICK	My apologies. I'm sorry.  (CROSSTALK)  	False	True	3
QUICK	Yes, you can.  	False	True	3

QUICK	Senator Rubio, thank you very much.  I would like to introduce my colleague, Rick Santelli, he has some comments as well, sir.  	False	True	3
QUICK	Rick, thank you very much.  Governor Huckabee, you have railed against income inequality. You've said that some Wall Street executives should have gone to jail over the roles that they played during the financial crisis.  Apart from your tax plan, are there specific steps you would require from corporate America to try and reduce the income inequality.  	False	True	3
QUICK	Governor?  	False	True	3
QUICK	Governor?  	False	True	3
QUICK	Thank you. Now, everybody else has fudged their time and gone over, so please, don't cut me off too quick, Becky.  	False	True	3

QUICK	It's at the moderator discretion.  	False	True	3
QUICK	Welcome back to the University of Colorado and the Republican presidential debate right here on CNBC.  Mr. Trump, I want to go back to an issue that we were talking about before, the H-1B visas. I found where I read that before. It was from the donaldjtrump.com website and it says -- it says that again, Mark Zuckerburg's personal senator, Marco Rubio has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities. Are you in favor of H-1Bs or are you opposed to them?  	False	True	3
QUICK	Thank you, sir.  	False	True	3
QUICK	You were. You get 30 seconds.  	False	True	3

QUICK	"I want to go back, if I may, to the... HARWOOD: Governor Christie, you've said something that many in your party do not believe, which is that climate change is undeniable, that human activity contributes to it, and you said, quote: ""The question is, what do we do to deal with it?"".  So what do we do?  "	False	True	3
QUICK	Senator Paul, among the leading conservative opponents to the creation of Medicare back in the 1960s was Ronald Reagan. He warned that it would lead to socialism. Considering the mounting cost of Medicare, was he right to oppose it?  	False	True	3
QUICK	Senator, thank you.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Becky, may I...  	False	True	3

RUBIO	Well, let me say, from protecting the people of Florida from imminent domain abuse, to bringing accountability to the V.A., to the Girls Count Act, to sanctioning groups, I'm proud of my service in the United States Senate and before that, in the Florida legislature.  I will say, if politics becomes and the presidency becomes about electing people who have been Congress or in the Senate the longest, we should all rally around Joe Biden. He's been around 1,000 years. He's passed hundreds of bills and I don't think any of us believe Joe Biden should be president of the United States.  And let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world.  That's why he passed Obamacare and the stimulus and Dodd-Frank and the deal with Iran. It is a systematic effort to change America. When I'm president of the United States, we are going to re-embrace all the things that made America the greatest nation in the world and we are going to leave our children with what they deserve: the single greatest nation in the history of the world.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	If I may respond to that. [applause]  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Well, I think the experience is not just what you did, but how it worked out. Under Chris Christie's governorship of New Jersey, they've been downgraded nine times in their credit rating. This country already has a debt problem, we don't need to add to it by electing someone who has experience at running up and destroying the credit rating of his state.  But I would add this. Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. He is trying to change this country. He wants America to become more like the rest of the world. We don't want to be like the rest of the world, we want to be the United States of America. And when I'm elected president, this will become once again, the single greatest nation in the history of the world, not the disaster Barack Obama has imposed upon us.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Chris — Chris, your state got hit by a massive snowstorm two weeks ago. You didn't even want to go back. They had to shame you into going back. And then you stayed there for 36 hours and then he left and came back to campaign. Those are the facts.  Here's the bottom line. This notion that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing is just not true. He knows exactly what he's doing.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Well, that's the — that's the reason why this campaign is so important. Because I think this notion — I think this is an important point. We have to understand what we're going through here. We are not facing a president that doesn't know what he's doing. He knows what he is doing. That's why he's done the things he's done.  That's why we have a president that passed Obamacare and the stimulus. All this damage that he's done to America is deliberate. This is a president that's trying to redefine this country. That's why this election is truly a referendum on our identity as a nation, as a people. Our future is at stake.  This election is not about the past. It is about what kind of country this is going to be in the 21st century, and if we elect someone like Barack Obama, a Hillary Clinton, a Bernie Sanders or anyone like that, our children are going to be the first Americans to inherit a diminishes country. That will not happen if I'm elected.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Chris, you didn't want to go back. You didn't want to go back. [applause]  	False	True	8
RUBIO	You didn't want to go back, Chris.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Chris, everybody — you said you weren't going to go back. He told everyone he wasn't going to go back. They had to shame him into going back. And when he decided to go back, he criticized the young lady, saying, what am I supposed to do, go back with a mop and clean up the flooding?  	False	True	8
RUBIO	... It's your record, it's not a talking point...  	False	True	8
RUBIO	But Martha, just — Martha, just to clarify on that point, because he's right, and one more thing to point — it is standard procedure of the United States to shoot down those missiles once launched if they pose a threat to civilians, land and ships.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Well — no, I understand. And not — but — but I think it's important to note that it is — and Senator Cruz, I think, was alluding to this, as well — it is the standard procedure of the United States, if those missiles pose a threat to land, civilians, our allies or any of our assets, to shoot down that missile in mid-flight.  I understand your question was about a preemptive strike, but my point is that there is in place now contingencies to avoid any sort of that strike from going errant and destroying any — any assets of the United States, or implicating or hurting any of our allies or any of our assets in the region.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Yeah. I have a — I got mentioned, can I respond?  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Here's the broader point, as well, and then I think it touches on what Donald just mentioned. Barack Obama views America as this arrogant global power that needed to be cut down to size. OK?  This is a president that views this country as a country that's been too powerful in the world and we create problems around the world.  For example, it's one of the reasons why he had betrayed Israel, because he believes that if we create separation from Israel, it will help our relations in the Islamic world. The same is happening in the Asia-Pacific region with accommodations to North Korea. North Korean should be back on that list of terrorist nations, as an example.  And Donald's absolutely right. China does have a lot of influence over North Korea and he should be leveraging our relationship with the Chinese to ensure that North Korea no longer has access to the resources that have allowed them — a country that has no economy to develop long range missiles already capable of reaching the west coast of the United States potentially.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Here's the bottom line. We can't get that legislation passed. The American people will not support doing anything about people that are in this country illegally until the law is enforced first, and you prove it to them.  This has been abundantly clear. Every effort over the last ten years to do those comprehensively has failed. And it has failed because the American people have zero trust that the federal government will enforce our laws.  And that's why since then, I have said repeatedly, if you are serious about immigration reform, then the key that unlocks the door to being able to do that is not just to pass a law that says it is going to enforce the law, but to actually do it. To hire the 20,000 new border agents, to finish the fencing and walls, to put in place mandatory e-verify, to put in place an entry-exit tracking system to prevent visa overstays.  And once that is in place and that's working, I believe the American people will support a very reasonable, but responsible approach to people that have been here a long time, who are not dangerous criminals, who pay taxes and pay fines for what they did.  But until then, none of that is going to be possible.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Well, the legislation passed, but it has no support. In essence, it couldn't pass in the House, it will never pass in the United States until we secure the border, and it is not the way we're going to do when I'm president.  When I'm president, we are going to enforce the law first, prove to people that illegal immigration is under control. And then we'll see what the American people are willing to support when it comes to people that are not criminals, who have been in the this country for a long time and who otherwise would like to stay.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Leadership is ultimately about solving the problem. And the approach that was tried and has been tried now repeatedly over ten years to do this comprehensively, all at once in a massive piece of legislation has no chance of passage.  It is not leadership to continue to try something that has no chance of happening. I want to make progress on this issue. It has been discussed now for 30 years and nothing ever happens.  And I am telling you that the only way forward on this issue that has any chance of happening, meaning gaining the support of the American people, you cannot do this without the support of the American people, is an approach that begins by proving that once and for all, illegal immigration is under control.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Good evening.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Well, I think conservatism is about three things and Donald touched on one of them, but it's about three things. The first is conservatism is about limited government, especially at the federal level. The federal government is a limited government, limited by the Constitution, which delineates its powers. If it's not in the Constitution, it does not belong to the federal government. It belongs to states, local communities and the private sector.  It's about free enterprise, which is an economic model that allows everyone to rise without pulling anyone down. The reason why free enterprise is the greatest economic model in the history of the world is because it's the only economic model where you can make poor people richer without making rich people poor.  And it's about a strong national defense. It's about believing, unlike Barack Obama, that the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military and the strongest nation on this planet. That's conservatism. [applause]  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Now, see, I was mentioned by Governor...  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Yeah.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	OK, good, then I'll get to it [inaudible]. Here's the...  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Well, no, sorry. Let me respond to that question.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Well, here's the response. I think anyone who believes that Barack Obama isn't doing what he's doing on purpose doesn't understand what we're dealing with here, OK? This is a president — this is a president who is trying to change this country. When he talked about change, he wasn't talking about dealing with our problems.  Obamacare was not an accident. The undermining of the Second Amendment is not an accident. The gutting of our military is not an accident. The undermining of America on the global stage is not an accident. Barack Obama is, indeed, trying to redefine this country. We better understand what we're dealing with here, because that's what Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders want to double down on if they are elected.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	No. He talked about Barack Obama.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Yeah.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	I don't know of any problem in America that's going to be fixed with a tax increase. We have an economy today, an economy today that is not creating jobs that pay enough.  And one of the reasons why is because we have one of the most expensive business tax rates on the planet. Our combined business rate puts us among the highest in the industrialized world. And then on top of that, we are the only one that has a worldwide system of taxation, where an American company who makes money abroad has to pay taxes where they made the money and then taxes a second time when they bring it back.  The combination of these two things has stranded over $2 trillion, the equivalent of the size of the Russian economy, $2 trillion of American corporate money stranded overseas, combined with all of these inversions of companies leaving us.  The solution to the problems we have today are not a tax increase. It is to lower our taxes on both people and on companies, so we can make America globally competitive again. [applause]  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Well, first, we need to understand who they are. ISIS is not just a jihadist group, they're an apocalyptic group. They want to trigger a showdown in a city named Tibet between the west and themselves which they believe will trigger the arrival of their messianic figure.  And I'm not saying that's what's going to happen. The reason why it's important to understand that is because these are not groups that are just going to go away on their own. They are going to have to be defeated. And I believe they need to be defeated on the ground, by a ground force, made up primarily of Sunni Arabs.  It will take Sunni Arabs to reject them ideologically and defeat them militarily. That will require a coalition of Iraqis and Syrians, that are also Sunnis, but it will also require the cooperation of Jordanians, Egyptians. We should ask more of the Saudis.  That will need to be backed up with more U.S. special operation forces alongside them. And it will have to be backed up with increased air strikes. And we are going to have to strike them, not just in Iraq and in Syria, but in every other part of the world where they have now created hubs of operation. They have affiliates in over a dozen countries across this planet. They have a sophisticated network of radicalizing people here in the homeland and around the world. [bell rings]  But it all begins by taking away their their safe operating spaces with a ground force that a U.S.-led coalition takes on. [applause]  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Because they currently occupy Sunni cities and villages. Sunni cities and villages can only truly be liberated and held by Sunnis themselves. If they are held by Shias it will trigger sectarian violence. The Kurds are incredible fighters and they will liberate the Kurdish areas, but Kurds can not and do not want to liberate and hold Sunni villages and towns.  It will take Sunni fighters themselves in that region to take those villages and cities, and then to hold them and avoid the sort of sectarian violence that follows in the past.  And why that is important is because if Sunnis are not able to govern themselves in these areas, you are going to have a successor group to ISIS. ISIS is a successor group of Al Qaida. In fact, they broke away...[bell rings]...from Al Qaida, because as horrible as Al Qaida is, ISIS thought Al Qaida was not radical enough. This is who we're dealing with, and they have more money than Al Qaida ever had.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Well, the problem with the Sunni forces in the region is they don't trust this administration. This administration cut a deal with their mortal enemies, the Shia, in Iran. It poisoned the well with these countries. It makes it very difficult to cooperate with them as a result.  They also, by the way, understand what real U.S. air power looks like. They saw the Iraq war. They saw, up close, also Afghanistan. They know what air power looks like when the United States is committed to the cause. And they see the airstrikes that are being conducted now, and they say to themselves, that's not real commitment. We know what real commitment looks like.  The — the Jordanian king was in Washington three weeks ago. He told everyone who would listen that they have begged for permission from the coalition to target caravans. And the coalition — meaning U.S. leadership on the ground...[bell rings]...would not allow them to proceed with those airstrikes.  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Well, when people talk about interrogating terrorists, they're acting like this is some sort of law enforcement function. Law enforcement is about gathering evidence to take someone to trial, and convict them. Anti-terrorism is about finding out information to prevent a future attack so the same tactics do not apply.  And, it is true, we should not be discussing in a wide spread way the exact tactics that we're going to use because that allows terrorist to know to practice how to evade us.  But, here's the bigger problem with all this, we're not interrogating anybody right now. Guantanamo's being emptied by this president. We should be putting people into Guantanamo, not emptying it out, and we shouldn't be releasing these killers who are rejoining the battlefield against the United States. [applause]  	False	True	8
RUBIO	I think it's already happening. Look at the turnout in Iowa. A historic number of people came out and voted in those caucuses. There are saying the same thing is going to happen here in New Hampshire. Look at the rallies that every single person on this stage is having. Much higher numbers than you used to see in the past and here is why.  Because people are starting to understand, very clearly, that this election is going to be a turning point. That 2016 is not just a choice between Republican or Democrat. It is a referendum on our identity as a nation and as a people.  So here is what Hillary Clinton needs to understand. We're going to have our primary, we're going to have our debates — which by the way, are twice as many as the Democrats have been willing to have themselves. But we're going to bring this party together and we are going to defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is unqualified to be the president of the United States of America.  She put classified information on her computer because she thinks she's above the law and anyone who lies to the families of people who have lost their loved ones in the service of our country like she did in Benghazi, can never be the commander-in-chief of the United States of America. [applause]  	False	True	8
RUBIO	I would. But that's not — the issue — my problem with what he did is he continues to put out this fiction that there's widespread systematic discrimination against Muslim Americans.  First of all, let's recognize this. If you go to a national cemetery in this country, you will see stars of Davids and crosses, but you see crescent moons. There are brave men and women who happen to be Muslim Americans who are serving this country in uniform and who have died in the service of this country. And we recognize that and we honor that. But by the same token, we face a very significant threat of home grown violent extremism.  We need to have strong, positive relationships in the Islamic communities in this country so they will identify and report this activity, especially mosques, for example, that are participating not just in hate speech, but inciting violence and taking acts against us.  And I do believe it is important also to recognize, you want to talk about religious discrimination in America. Well, I don't think Barack Obama is being sued by any Islamic groups, but he is being sued by the Little Sisters of the Poor. We are facing in this country Christian groups and groups that hold traditional values who feel and in fact are being discriminated against by the laws of this country that try to force them to vie to violate their conscience. [applause]  	False	True	8
RUBIO	First, let me say there are already women today serving in roles that are like combat. That, in fact, whose lives are in very serious danger, and so I have no problem whatsoever with people of either gender serving in combat so long as the minimum requirements necessary to do the job are not compromised. But, I support that, and obviously now that that is the case I do believe that Selective Service should be opened up for both men and women in case a Draft is ever instituted.  I think the more fundamental challenge we're now facing is what's happening to the U.S. military — I've said this many times, and I think it's important to start paying attention to this. Our Air Force is about to be the smallest it's been in 100 years. I'm sorry, in our history. Our Army is set to be smaller than it's been since the second World War, and our Navy is about to be the smallest than it's been in 100 years.  I think we need to begin to refocus on rebuilding our military because every time we have cut our military in the history of this country we have had to come back later and rebuild it, and it costs more, and it's a lot more chaotic and dangerous. When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military. [applause]  	False	True	8
RUBIO	"Well, my brother's a veteran. We're very proud of him in our family. He served as a green beret in the 7th Special Forces from 1968 through 1971. And as part of his training, he jumped out of an airplane and he lost his two front teeth.  And for years, he's had to go to get these dental claims. And every times he goes to get one of these dental claims filled, the V.A. asks him, ""well, how do we know you lost your teeth in the Army?"" And he says, ""well, it's the only time I ever jumped out of a plane."" [laughter] But he's had to fight through this process, and I've watched it firsthand. That's why I'm proud that I worked in a bipartisan way. We passed the V.A. Accountability bill that, for the first time, allows us to fire — allows the V.A. secretary to fire someone who's not doing a good job, who's a senior executive.  And the governor's right. They've only fired three people up to now. More people will be fired if I'm president. But the portability part of it is incredibly important.  Veterans should be able to take their V.A. benefits to any hospital or any doctor they want to go to. When I am president of the United States, veterans will be able to take their benefits to any hospital or doctor that they choose. [applause]  "	False	True	8
RUBIO	Well, first of all, I don't believe that believing in traditional marriage the way I do makes you a bigot or a hater. It means that you believe that this institution that's been around for millenial is an important cornerstone of society. I respect people that believe differently. But I believe deeply, that marriage should be between one man and one woman. [applause]  On the issue of life, to me, the issue of life is not a political issue. It's a human rights issue and it's a difficult issue, because it puts in conflict two competing rights. On the one hand is the right of a woman to choose what to do with her body which is a real right.  And on the other hand is the right of an unborn human child to live. And they're in conflict. And as a policy maker, I must choose which one of these two sides takes precedence. And I have chosen to err on the side of life.  Here's what I find outrageous. There has been five Democratic debates. The media has not asked them a single question on abortion and on abortion, the Democrats are extremists. Why doesn't the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that all abortion should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child.  Why don't they ask Hillary Clinton why she believe that partial- birth abortion, which is a gruesome procedure that has been outlawed in this country, she thinks that's a fundamental right. They are the extremists...[bell rings]...when it comes to the issue of abortion and I can't wait to expose them in a general election. [applause]  	False	True	8
RUBIO	I do support protection for the life of the mother because I'm pro-life. I just believe deeply that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws. If I'm president and there's a bill that's passed that saves lives but it has exceptions, I'll sign it.  But I do believe deeply that all human life is worthy of the protection of laws. I've already said, for me, the issue of life is not a political issue and I want to be frank. I would rather lose an election than be wrong on the issue of life. [applause]  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Well, I was going for Peyton Manning, but now I'm rooting for Carolina. [laughter]  	False	True	8
RUBIO	Thank you. You know, this week I had the great pleasure of having my kids join me on the campaign trail. I hadn't' seen them in a while, and it was great to have them alongside me, but the most important part of it is that it once again reminded me of what's at stake.  Here in New Hampshire in less than 72 hours, we are literally deciding what kind of country we will be like when they are my age. What kind of country they will be able to raise their families in. And, that's why I'm asking you for your vote. You vote for me, and we will unite this party, we will grow the conservative movement, we will defeat Hillary Clinton, and we will leave our children what our parents left us. The single greatest nation in the history of all mankind.  Thank you. [applause]  	False	True	8
KASICH	Well, we've got to to step up the pressure. And by the way, I've gotta say, after being here, every one of my 100 town hall meetings in New Hampshire were a lot more fun than what I saw here today, were so much more positive.  Look, in terms of North Korea, Martha, we have to make sure that we intercept both the ships and their aircraft, because what they're trying to do is to proliferate this very dangerous material, along with the — with the technology, the instruments that can be used for mass destruction.  That's what I worry about the most, frankly, is non-state actors, people who don't have a uniform, people don't have a country, who can spread this, who are not subject to the — to the mutual assured defense. In other words, you strike us, we strike you.  Some of these radicals, they don't care about that. That's what I worry about, for my children, and for their children, going forward. So, we have to be very tough.  And we should tell the Chinese, look, if you're not going to do this ballistic missile defense to the Koreans, ballistic missile defense to Japan — and by the way, we should impose the same kind of sanctions on North Korea that we imposed on Iran, because they're able to shift money. They're able to send money and receive money. [bell rings]  We've gotta to be very tough on this. And frankly, I think we could have — I think we could have let the Japanese know that if you want to take action on that — on that missile that's rising, you want to take action — you will have our support, if that's what you think is the best thing to do. We cannot continue to be weak in the face of the North Koreans, or, frankly, in the entire rest of the world.  Martha, this is — this is the — relates...  	False	True	8
KASICH	Well, you know, David, I — I've just spent a lot of time here in this state, as I mentioned earlier, and we have to have practical solutions, just like we were just talking about a few minutes ago on North Korea. Look, the situation is, we need to finish the border. It has to be completed. Just like we lock our doors at night, the country has to be able to lock its doors. And we can have a guest worker program, where people can come in and out in an orderly way.  And then for the 11.5 million that are here, if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, I believe they ought to pay some back taxes, pay a fine, never get on the path to citizenship, but get legalization. It is not — I couldn't even imagine how we would even begin to think about taking a mom or a dad out of a house when they have not committed a crime since they've been here, leaving their children in the house. I mean, that is not, in my opinion, the kind of values that we believe in.  And secondly, I think at the end of the day, that Americans would support a plan like this. I think Congress would pass a plan to finish the border, guest worker, pay a fine, a path to legalization, and not citizenship. And we've got to get this done. And I will tell you this, within the first 100 days that I am president, I will put that proposal to the Congress. And I will tell you, as a former Congressman, and an executive, in Ohio, I can promise you that I believe you'll get the votes to pass that, and we can move on with that issue and protect our border. That's what I think.  	False	True	8
KASICH	Good evening.  	False	True	8
KASICH	"Well, first of all, look. As the New York Times said, he's certainly not a moderate, but he can bring people together to solve problems. The fact of the matter is I've cut taxes more than anybody in the country this year. I have balanced budgets, the federal budget, the state of Ohio budget, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're up 400,000 jobs, and in Washington we were able to have significant job growth whenever we balanced the budget of which I was the architect.  But, here's the beauty of it, it's not just balancing a budget, it's about jobs. You know, when I was kid growing up in a neighborhood where Dad went home at night and said, ""I lost my job today"", it just killed the family.  It just was a devastating effect. We have to have economic growth, but once we have economic growth I believe we have to reach out to people who live in the shadows. I believe we need to help the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor. We need to help the developmentally disabled to rise, and we need to help our friends in the minority community develop entrepreneurship. In other words, in American, conservatism should mean not only that some rise with conservative principles, but everybody has a chance to rise regardless of who they are so they can live their God given purpose. That's what conservatism should be. [applause]  "	False	True	8
KASICH	David?  	False	True	8
KASICH	Look, I'm — I'm not here — I like Chris.  	False	True	8
KASICH	Let — but let me — let me just tell you. First of all, we have the lowest number of state employees in 30 years.  Secondly, we have grown government at the rate of inflation. And I went from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus. And we've grown jobs by 400,000 — that's one of the fastest growing states in the country. Our pensions are secure and our credit is rock solid.  Now, I've learned that, what makes things work, what gets the economy going, not just in Ohio, but in Washington — and it's three things. Common sense regulations, which we have, lower taxes, which we have, the lowest taxes, tax cuts in the country. And thirdly, a fiscal plan to balance the budget.  When you go from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black, when you cut taxes by $5 billion and you grow over 400,000 jobs, that is a record that I can take to Washington, using the same formula that I used in Washington when I was part of the effort to balance the budget to give us a surplus and to create jobs.  	False	True	8
KASICH	That's what I did and I'll do it again in the first 100 days.  	False	True	8
KASICH	Well, right now the deals — there's no leadership. I mean, a lot of the things that we're talking about here tonight, on the border, and so many of the things. What we should be doing on foreign policy, you know what the problem is, Mary Katharine? There's not a leader that gets somebody to rise.  You have to have a leader that can inspire, and actually some of what Donald was saying is true. Look, do you know how hard it was...  	False	True	8
KASICH	... to get the balance the federal budget balanced? You have to plead with people. To do what we've done in Ohio, you have to plead with people, then you go back down to Washington and do the same thing.  See, we have to remind people we're Americans before we're Republicans and Democrats, and when we wait, and when we delay what we end up doing, Mary Katharine, is we make the United States weaker. In fact, it's a foreign policy issue because people look at America not solving problems and they say what are they doing over there? The point is you have to work with people.  	False	True	8
KASICH	Mary Katherine, let me just say this to you. [applause]  You must have an agenda that you are ready to move on in the first 100 days. Jeb is right. If you delay and you wait, the Washington operators will take you down. I can tell you this, in the first 100 days, I will have legislation to freeze federal regulations, have them reviewed by the vice president, reduce state taxes on individuals, reduce taxes on corporations, have a fiscal plan to balance the budget, get the border protected and begin to fix Social Security in the first 100 days.  So, anybody who is here tonight, if I get elected president, head out tomorrow and buy a seat belt, because there's going to be so much happening in the first 100 days, it's going to make your head spin. We're going to move America forward. I promise you. We're going to move us forward. [applause]  	False	True	8
KASICH	Jeb mentioned me. Time for me to go again.  	False	True	8
KASICH	He says he didn't mention me the second time. I thought I heard it, Jeb. No. I'm just kidding. Thank you all very much for listening and being patient with all of us tonight. Thank you.  	False	True	8
KASICH	David, David...  	False	True	8
KASICH	I wanted — I wanted to say, look, this — there can be a win-win here. I have formed a collaborative between police and community leaders because people have to respect law enforcement. A family doesn't want dad or mom going home in a box. And for our community leaders, many of them think the system not only works — not only doesn't work for them, but it works against them.  And I created a big collaborative in Ohio made up of law enforcement, community leaders, the head of my public safety and a former Democrat, liberal Senate senator Nina Turner, run it. They got together, they made recommendations on recruiting, on hiring, on the use of deadly force and what we're about to do is to bring community and police together so we can have a win-win.  We need more win-wins in America and we don't have to pick one over another divide. We love the police, but we've got to be responsible to the people in the community. We have to do all of that. [applause]  	False	True	8
KASICH	Josh?  	False	True	8
KASICH	Josh, I mean, clearly, when a veteran comes home, they should get health care anywhere they want to go. In our state, which is what we should do in the country, you know, if they drive a truck from Kabul to Kandahar in Afghanistan, we say, you can drive a truck from Columbus to Cleveland, and you don't have to go get a license. We're going to hand you one.  And if you've got expertise in the military, we're going to give you college credit or community college credit for the things that you did for our country. And in addition to that, I'll tell you, one of the biggest things I think has to be done — and I would do it as president — the Pentagon has got to work with the returning soldier, sailor, along with the family, and we — they're the most valuable employees in the country. I call them golden employees.  Everybody wants to hire a veteran. But there is a disconnect between the job openings and the veteran when the veteran comes back. The veteran is a leader. The veteran is strong. The veteran is drug free. There should be no unemployment among veterans.  And if the Pentagon will work with the veterans' services agencies all across this country, Josh, we can get people jobs and we can get them jobs quickly, get them their health care...[bell rings]...get them their college education. Let's lift them. They're the greatest people defending the United States of America and we need to take care of them, and we will. We will. [applause]  	False	True	8
KASICH	Carolina's going to win that one. I hate to say it. But they're going to win that one.  	False	True	8
KASICH	Well, folks, I've done now over 100 town hall meetings and I've loved every second of it. It has been the greatest thing in the world. And I want you to know that you've changed me, because I've listened to your stories and I've had your hugs and I've seen your tears, and I've seen you walk away and say, I now have hope.  You know, I've had a conservative message, but a positive message — not just a conservative message, but a positive message about how we can bring people together, how we can restore America's strength, lift everyone. New Hampshire, please give me a chance to carry this message forward to the United States of America. And then, I will come back. Thank you, loved it. And God bless you. [applause]  	False	True	8
KELLY	Tonight, we are coming to you live from the Iowa Event Center in downtown Des Moines, in the shadow of the Iowa state capitol. In just four days, people here in the Hawkeye State will caucus and cast the first votes of the 2016 election.  	False	True	7
KELLY	Seven candidates are on that stage tonight, their position on the stage determined by their standing in the latest national polls, as well as polls in Iowa and New Hampshire. And here they are.  Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [applause]  Florida Senator Marco Rubio. [applause]  	False	True	7
KELLY	Wow.  	False	True	7
KELLY	So let's get started.  Senator Cruz, before we get to the issues, let's address the elephant not in the room tonight. [laughter]  Donald Trump has chosen not to attend this evening's presidential debate. What message do you think that sends to the voters of Iowa?  	False	True	7
KELLY	The divide between you and Mr. Trump has turned into one of the biggest stories in the country. And for six months that — your campaign, during this campaign, you praised Mr. Trump as somebody who you thought was an effective voice against the Washington cartel. You said you were glad that he was running as a Republican.  But when he started to criticize you, your message changed, and you suddenly started to portray him as the voice of the Washington cartel, and suggested he would do the Democrats' bidding. Which is it?  	False	True	7
KELLY	Senator Christie, you began this campaign touting your record as a Republican from a blue state who knows how to get things done and reach across the aisle. However, many Republicans feel that reaching across the aisle and getting things done isn't great if you get the wrong things done. And they prefer to stand on principle rather than compromise. Why are they wrong and you're right?  	False	True	7
KELLY	But first, you can join tonight's conversation right from home. Go to google.com or open your Google search app and search Fox News debate to vote on which candidate you think has the best plan to defeat ISIS. We'll be right back.  [commercial break]  	False	True	7
KELLY	We have a lot — we have a lot to cover. But we want to — we want to turn the page to domestic...  [crosstalk]  	False	True	7
KELLY	No, no. No.  	False	True	7
KELLY	No no no, because we want to turn the page to domestic terror, and let me tell you why: we're partnering with Google on this debate, and they're telling us...  	False	True	7
KELLY	... that their search results have gone through the roof on — on people...  	False	True	7
KELLY	... you're a good man, Governor Kasich.  	False	True	7
KELLY	People — the search results — the searches for terror issues, for safety issues in America have gone through the roof, increased over 400 percent since 2008.  People are worried. They're worried about what's happening in the country and about a domestic terror attack, as all of you know. Now, when combating this threat, Senator Rubio, you've advocated closing down mosques — we'll get back to you.  Well, you have advocated closing down — closing down mosques, diners, any place where radicalization is occurring. You told me that. But the Supreme Court has made clear that hateful speech is generally protected by the First Amendment.  In other words, radical Muslims have the right to be radical Muslims, unless they turn to terror. Doesn't your position run afoul of the First Amendment?  	False	True	7
KELLY	Senator Paul, do you agree with that? We're gonna close down mosques, we're gonna close down diners where we think radical thinking's occurring? [crosstalk]  	False	True	7
KELLY	Governor Christie, let's talk about profiling. [applause]  In December...  	False	True	7
KELLY	... profiling. Profiling. In December, two radical Muslims killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. Neighbors of the terrorists said that they did not report the couple to law enforcement prior to the crime, because they were afraid that they would be accused of profiling.  Now, you have said that we should not profile. How do you square that with the San Bernardino case?  	False	True	7
KELLY	They didn't know they were going to attack the country.  	False	True	7
KELLY	That's not true. The neighbors said they saw men going in and out of the garage. They saw packages being delivered. They saw Muslims, and they did not think that was enough to call the cops. Do you?  	False	True	7
KELLY	Dr. Carson, this week a female Muslim who served in the U.S. Air Force asked Hillary Clinton the question, she asked whether the United States is still the best place in which to raise her three Muslim children. Given what she perceives as a rise in Islamaphobia in this country. Do you think the GOP messaging on Muslims has stoked the flames of bias on this as the Democrats suggest, and how would you answer this veteran?  	False	True	7
KELLY	Governor Kasich, stand back. You appear to back in another debate, a so-called back door to encrypted cell phone technology, which protects most smartphones that we all have from hacking. And it includes our phones and it also protects the cell phones of the terrorist.  Now the tech companies and a group of MIT scientists, smart guys, right, warn that if they create a way for the FBI to have a back door into our encrypted communications, then the bad guys will exploit it too. And they say that this is going to cause more security problems than it would solve for everyday Americans. Are they wrong?  	False	True	7
KELLY	But this is public testimony.  	False	True	7
KELLY	Governor, thank you. [applause]  	False	True	7
KELLY	Welcome back, everybody. We are live in Des Moines, Iowa. And let's get right back to the questions — Bret.  	False	True	7
KELLY	All right. We're going to move on. Because coming up, immigration, and something you've never seen before.  Stay tuned, right after this break.  [commercial break]  	False	True	7
KELLY	Welcome back everyone. Live, in Des Moines, Iowa. Now, we move onto the topic of immigration. Senator Rubio, we'll start with you. When you ran for Senate in 2010, you made clear that you opposed legalization and citizenship for illegal immigrants. You promised repeatedly that you would oppose it as a U.S. Senator as well. Here are just a few examples. Watch.  [begin video clip]  	False	True	7
KELLY	Within two years of getting elected you were co-sponsoring legislation to create a path to citizenship, in your words, amnesty. Haven't you already proven that you cannot be trusted on this issue?  	False	True	7
KELLY	... But, you went on from there...  	False	True	7
KELLY	... You said more than that, Senator...  	False	True	7
KELLY	... You said earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. You...  	False	True	7
KELLY	... supported earned path to citizenship...  	False	True	7
KELLY	Governor Bush, do you agree Senator Rubio has not reversed himself on his immigration promise?  	False	True	7
KELLY	Go ahead, senator.  	False	True	7
KELLY	All right.  	False	True	7
KELLY	All right. This will be the last one.  	False	True	7
KELLY	OK. Let's move on. Senator Cruz, when Senator Rubio proposed that bill creating a path to citizenship, you proposed an amendment. It would have allowed for legalization but not citizenship. Yes, it would.  Pressed last month on why you supported legalization, you claimed that you didn't. Right? Like you just did. Saw that. [laughter]  You argued that this was just a poison pill amendment, basically it's something designed to kill the bill and not actually get it through. But that is not, however, how it sounded at the time. Watch.  [begin video clip]  	False	True	7
KELLY	Was that all an act? It was pretty convincing.  	False	True	7
KELLY	But the bill allowed both. The bill you were amending allowed citizenship and legalization.  	False	True	7
KELLY	OK, sir.  	False	True	7
KELLY	Senator Paul. [applause]  You know how Washington works. Do you buy that?  	False	True	7
KELLY	Go ahead, sir. [applause]  	False	True	7
KELLY	Senator Rubio, even Chuck Schumer, your co-sponsor of that bill...  	False	True	7
KELLY	... agrees with Ted Cruz on this.  	False	True	7
KELLY	Go ahead, Senator Cruz. [applause]  	False	True	7
KELLY	All right.  	False	True	7
KELLY	Go ahead, Governor Christie.  	False	True	7
KELLY	Let's go to a Youtube question. Let's get to a Youtube question. This is a question from a Youtube creator with over 2 million subscribers. Watch.  	False	True	7
KELLY	Dr. Carson, that's one — that one's for you.  	False	True	7
KELLY	Go ahead.  	False	True	7
KELLY	All right.  	False	True	7
KELLY	All right. We're moving on. [applause]  	False	True	7
KELLY	Governor bush, poll after poll shows you running among the worst in your party against Hillary Clinton. Even Mitt Romney said that a Bush v. Clinton head-to-head would be too easy for the Democrats.  Yet still you and the super PACs supporting you continue to blanket the airwaves with cutting ads, not against Mrs. Clinton, but against your fellow Republicans, especially Senator Rubio.  Do these attacks do more harm than good by targeting those candidates who appear to have the best chance of defeating Mrs. Clinton?  	False	True	7
KELLY	Welcome back, everybody. Let's get back to the questions. Chris?  	False	True	7
KELLY	Senator Paul, you have suggested that former President Bill Clinton's history with women is fair game in this campaign. How do you answer those who say you don't hold the sins of the husband against the wife?  	False	True	7
KELLY	Of her husband's?  	False	True	7
KELLY	Welcome back, everybody. And now, it is time for closing statements. The candidates each get 30 seconds.  And we begin with Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.  	False	True	7
KELLY	Ohio Governor Kasich.  	False	True	7
KELLY	Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Governor.  	False	True	7
KELLY	Texas Senator, Ted Cruz. Senator.  	False	True	7
KELLY	Gentlemen, thank you all so much for being here tonight. We appreciate it greatly. And that does it for the seventh Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential race. But we're not done. The Kelly file starts in a moment and guess who is going to be there? Senator Ted Cruz.  	False	True	7
COOPER	I'm Anderson Cooper. Thanks for joining us. We've already welcomed the candidates on stage. They are in place at their podiums. Before we dive into the issues, I want to quickly explain some of the groundrules tonight.  As the moderator, I'll ask questions, followups and guide the discussion. I'll be joined in the questioning by CNN's Juan Carlos Lopez and Dana Bash, a well as Don Lemon who will share questions from Democrats around the country. Each candidate will get one minute to answer questions, and 30 seconds for followups and rebuttals. I'll give candidates time to respond if they have been singled out for criticism.  Our viewers should know that we have lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when their time is up.  I want the candidates to be able to introduce themselves to our audience. Each candidate will have two minutes to introduce themselves.  Let's begin with Governor Chafee.  Governor?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Thank you very much, Governor. [applause]  Senator Webb, you have two minutes.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor O'Malley, you have two minutes.  O'MALLEY: My name is Martin O'Malley, former Mayor of Baltimore, former governor of Maryland, a life long democrat, and most importantly, a husband, and a father.  My wife Katie and I have four great kids, Grace, and Tara, and William and Jack. And, like you, there is nothing we wouldn't do to give them healthier and better lives. There are some things that I have learned to do better in life than others. And, after 15 years of executive experience, I have learned how to be an effective leader.  Whether it was raising the minimum wage, making our public schools the best in America, passing marriage equality, the DREAM Act, and comprehensive gun safety legislation, I have learned how to get things done because I am very clear about my principals.  Thanks to President Obama, our country has come a long way since the Wall Street crash of 2008. Our country's doing better, we are creating jobs again. But we elected a president, not a magician, and there is urgent work that needs to be done right now. For there is a — deep injustice, an economic injustice that threatens to tear our country apart, and it will not solve itself. Injustice does not solve itself.  What I'm talking about is this, our middle class is shrinking. Our poor families are becoming poorer, and 70 percent of us are earning the same, or less than we were 12 years ago. We need new leadership, and we need action. The sort of action that will actually make wages go up again for all American families.  Our economy isn't money, it's people. It's all of our people, and so we must invest in our country, and the potential of our kids to make college a debt free option for all of our families, instead of settling our kids with a lifetime of crushing debt.  And, we must square our shoulders to the great challenge of climate change and make this threat our opportunity. The future is what we make of it. We are all in this together. And, the question in this election is whether you and I still have the ability to give our kids a better future. I believe we do, that is why I am running for president, and I need your help.  Thank you. [applause]  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor O'Malley, thank you very much. Senator Sanders.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton?  	True	False	1
COOPER	"Thank you, all. It is time to start the debate.  Are you all ready? [applause]  All right. Let's begin. We're going to be discussing a lot of the issues, many of the issues, important issues that you have brought up. But I want to begin with concerns that voters have about each of the candidates here on this stage that they have about each of you.  Secretary Clinton, I want to start with you. Plenty of politicians evolve on issues, but even some Democrats believe you change your positions based on political expediency.  You were against same-sex marriage. Now you're for it. You defended President Obama's immigration policies. Now you say they're too harsh. You supported his trade deal dozen of times. You even called it the ""gold standard"". Now, suddenly, last week, you're against it.  Will you say anything to get elected?  "	True	False	1
COOPER	"Secretary Clinton, though, with all due respect, the question is really about political expediency. Just in July, New Hampshire, you told the crowd you'd, quote, ""take a back seat to no one when it comes to progressive values.""  Last month in Ohio, you said you plead guilty to, quote, ""being kind of moderate and center."" Do you change your political identity based on who you're talking to?  "	True	False	1
COOPER	Just for the record, are you a progressive, or are you a moderate?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary...  	True	False	1
COOPER	...thank you...  	True	False	1
COOPER	...Senator...  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Sanders. A Gallup poll says half the country would not put a socialist in the White House. You call yourself a democratic socialist. How can any kind of socialist win a general election in the United States?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Denmark is a country that has a population — Denmark is a country that has a population of 5.6 million people. The question is really about electability here, and that's what I'm trying to get at.  You — the — the Republican attack ad against you in a general election — it writes itself. You supported the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. You honeymooned in the Soviet Union. And just this weekend, you said you're not a capitalist.  Doesn't — doesn't that ad write itself?  	True	False	1
COOPER	You don't consider yourself a capitalist, though?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Just let me just be clear. Is there anybody else on the stage who is not a capitalist?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Sanders?  	True	False	1
COOPER	We're going to get...  	True	False	1
COOPER	We're going to have a lot more on these issues. But I do want to just quickly get everybody in on the question of electability.  Governor Chafee, you've been everything but a socialist. When you were senator from Rhode Island, you were a Republican. When you were elected governor, you were an independent. You've only been a Democrat for little more than two years. Why should Democratic voters trust you won't change again?  	True	False	1
COOPER	It seems like pretty soft granite. I mean, you've been a Republican, you've been an independent.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Then why change labels?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor O'Malley, the concern of voters about you is that you tout our record as Baltimore's mayor. As we all know, we all saw it. That city exploded in riots and violence in April.  The current top prosecutor in Baltimore, also a Democrat, blames your zero tolerance policies for sowing the seeds of unrest. Why should Americans trust you with the country when they see what's going on in the city that you ran for more than seven years?  O'MALLEY: Yes, actually, I believe what she said was that there's a lot of policies that have led to this unrest.  But, Anderson, when I ran for mayor of Baltimore in 1999...  	True	False	1
COOPER	She actually — just for the record, when she was asked which policies, to name two, she said zero tolerance. I mean, there's a number of old policies that we're seeing the results of. That distress of communities, where communities don't want to step forward and say who killed a 3-year-old, it's a direct result of these failed policies.  O'MALLEY: Well, let's talk about this a little bit. One of the things that was not reported during that heartbreaking night of unrest in Baltimore was that arrests had actually fallen to a 38-year low in the year prior to the Freddie Gray's tragic death.  Anderson, when I ran for mayor of Baltimore back in 1999, it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we allowed ourselves to become the most violent, addicted, and abandoned city in America.  And I ran and promised people that together we could turn that around. And we put our city on a path to reduce violent crime, or part one (ph) crime by more than any other major city in America over the next 10 years.  I did not make our city immune to setbacks. But I attended a lot of funerals, including one for a family of seven who were firebombed in their sleep for picking up the phone in a poor African-American neighborhood and calling the police because of drug dealers on their corner.  We've saved over a thousand lives in Baltimore in the last 15 years of people working together. And the vast majority of them were young and poor and black. It wasn't easy on any day. But we saved lives and we gave our city a better future, improving police and community relations every single day that I was in office.  	True	False	1
COOPER	"In one year alone, though, 100,000 arrests were made in your city, a city of 640,000 people. The ACLU, the NAACP sued you, sued the city, and the city actually settled, saying a lot of those arrests were without probable cause.  O'MALLEY: Well, I think the key word in your followup there was the word ""settle."" That's true. It was settled. Arrests peaked in 2003, Anderson, but they declined every year after that as we restored peace in our poorer neighborhoods so that people could actually walk and not have to worry about their kids or their loved ones of being victims of violent crime.  Look, none of this is easy. None of us has all the answers. But together as a city, we saved a lot of lives. It was about leadership. It was about principle. And it was about bringing people together.  "	True	False	1
COOPER	Thank you, Governor.  O'MALLEY: Thank you.  	True	False	1
COOPER	"Senator Webb, in 2006, you called affirmative action ""state-sponsored racism."" In 2010, you wrote an op/ed saying it discriminates against whites. Given that nearly half the Democratic Party is non-white, aren't you out of step with where the Democratic Party is now?  "	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Webb, thank you very much.  Let's move on to some of the most pressing issues facing our country right now, some of the biggest issues right now in the headlines today. We're going to start with guns. The shooting in Oregon earlier this month, once again it brought the issue of guns into the national conversation. Over the last week, guns have been the most discussed political topic on Facebook by two to one.  Senator Sanders, you voted against the Brady bill that mandated background checks and a waiting period. You also supported allowing riders to bring guns in checked bags on Amtrak trains. For a decade, you said that holding gun manufacturers legally responsible for mass shootings is a bad idea. Now, you say you're reconsidering that. Which is it: shield the gun companies from lawsuits or not?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Do you want to shield gun companies from lawsuits?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton, is Bernie Sanders tough enough on guns?  	True	False	1
COOPER	We're going to bring you all in on this. But, Senator Sanders, you have to give a response.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor O'Malley, you passed gun legislation as governor of Maryland, but you had a Democratic-controlled legislature. President Obama couldn't convince Congress to pass gun legislation after the massacres in Aurora, in Newtown, and Charleston. How can you?  O'MALLEY: And, Anderson, I also had to overcome a lot of opposition in the leadership of my own party to get this done. Look, it's fine to talk about all of these things — and I'm glad we're talking about these things — but I've actually done them.  We passed comprehensive gun safety legislation, not by looking at the pollings or looking at what the polls said. We actually did it. And, Anderson, here tonight in our audience are two people that make this issue very, very real. Sandy and Lonnie Phillips are here from Colorado. And their daughter, Jessie, was one of those who lost their lives in that awful mass shooting in Aurora.  Now, to try to transform their grief, they went to court, where sometimes progress does happen when you file in court, but in this case, you want to talk about a — a rigged game, Senator? The game was rigged. A man had sold 4,000 rounds of military ammunition to this — this person that killed their daughter, riddled her body with five bullets, and he didn't even ask where it was going.  And not only did their case get thrown out of court, they were slapped with $200,000 in court fees because of the way that the NRA gets its way in our Congress and we take a backseat. It's time to stand up and pass comprehensive gun safety legislation as a nation. [applause]  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Sanders, I want you to be able to respond, 30 seconds.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Let me bring in somebody who has a different viewpoint. Senator Webb, your rating from the NRA, you once had an A rating from the NRA. You've said gun violence goes down when more people are allowed to carry guns. Would encouraging more people to be armed be part of your response to a mass shooting?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator...  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator — Governor Chafee, you have an F rating from the NRA, what do you think about what Senator Webb just said?  	True	False	1
COOPER	I want to...  O'MALLEY: ...Anderson, when the NRA wrote to everyone in our state — when the NRA wrote to members in our state and told people with hunting traditions lies about what our comprehensive gun safety legislation is, I wrote right back to them and laid out what it actually did. And that's why, not only did we pass it, but the NRA didn't...  	True	False	1
COOPER	...I want to move on to another issue, which is in the headlines right now, another crisis making headlines.  Secretary Clinton, Russia, they're challenging the U.S. in Syria. According to U.S. intelligence, they've lied about who they're bombing. You spearheaded the reset with Russia. Did you underestimate the Russians, and as president, what would your response to Vladimir Putin be right now in Syria?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Sanders, what would you do differently.  	True	False	1
COOPER	On this issue of foreign policy, I want to go to...  	True	False	1
COOPER	I want to go to Dana Bash. Dana?  	True	False	1
COOPER	But, Senator Sanders, you didn't answer the question. Under what — under what circumstances would you actually use force?  	True	False	1
COOPER	I'm gonna bring you all in on this. Governor — Governor O'Malley, Secretary Clinton...  	True	False	1
COOPER	"Secretary Clinton voted to authorize military force in Iraq, supported more troops in Afghanistan. As Secretary of State, she wanted to arm Syrian rebels and push for the bombing of Libya. Is she too quick to use military force?  O'MALLEY: Anderson, no president — no commander in chief — should take the military option off the table, even if most of us would agree that it should be the last option.  What disturbed people so much about — and I would agree with Senator Sanders on this — leading us into Iraq under false pretenses and telling us, as a people, that there were weapons of mass destruction there was — was one of the worst blunders in modern American history.  But the reason why people remain angry about it is because people feel like a lot of our legislators got railroaded in a war fever and by polls. And I remember being at a dinner shortly before that invasion. People were talking at — and saying, ""it'll take us just a couple years to rebuild democracy,"" and I thought, ""has this world gone mad?""  Whenever we go — and contrary to John Quincy Adams' advice — ""searching the world for monsters to destroy,"" and when we use political might to take a — at the expense of democratic principle, we hurt ourselves, and we hurt our [inaudible].  "	True	False	1
COOPER	Does she — does she want to use military force too rapidly?  O'MALLEY: I believe that, as president, I would not be so quick to pull for a military tool. I believe that a no-fly zone in Syria, at this time, actually, Secretary, would be a mistake.  You have to enforce no-fly zones, and I believe, especially with the Russian air force in the air, it could lead to an escalation because of an accident that we would deeply regret.  I support President Obama. I think we have to play a long game, and I think, ultimately — you want to talk about blunders? I think Assad's invasion of Syria will be seen as a blunder.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor O'Malley, just for the record, on the campaign trail, you've been saying that Secretary Clinton is always quick for the — for the military intervention. Senator — Secretary Clinton, you can respond.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Well — yes, you'll be coming in next, but she was directly quoted, Senator.  	True	False	1
COOPER	OK.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Thank you.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Thank you, Secretary.  [crosstalk]  	True	False	1
COOPER	"Senator Webb, you said as president you would never have used military force in Libya and that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was, in your words, ""inevitable."" Should Secretary Clinton have seen that attack coming?  "	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator...  	True	False	1
COOPER	You're over your time as of now.  	True	False	1
COOPER	You agreed to these debate rules.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Sanders, I want you to be able to respond.  	True	False	1
COOPER	I'd like you to be able to respond and get in on this.  	True	False	1
COOPER	He doesn't seem to be the type of guy to regret a lot.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton, on the campaign trail, Governor Webb has said that he would never have used military force in Libya and that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was inevitable. Should you have seen that attack coming?  	True	False	1
COOPER	But American citizens did lose their lives in Benghazi.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor O'Malley?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Webb, I want you to be able to respond.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Webb?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary (sic) Webb, you served in Vietnam. You're a marine. Once a marine, always a marine. You served as a marine in Vietnam. You're a decorated war hero. You eventually became secretary of the navy.  During the Vietnam War, the man standing next to you, Senator Sanders, applied for status as a conscientious objector. Given his history, can he serve as a credible commander-in-chief?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Sanders, tell an American soldier who is watching right now tonight in Afghanistan why you can be commander-in- chief given that you applied for conscientious objector status.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Very quickly, 30 seconds for each of you. Governor Chafee, who or what is the greatest national security threat to the United States? I want to go down the line.  	True	False	1
COOPER	OK. Senator, I can give you 30 seconds to respond.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Thirty seconds for each of you. Governor Chafee, what is the greatest national security threat to the United States?  	True	False	1
COOPER	OK.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor O'Malley?  O'MALLEY: I believe that nuclear Iran remains the biggest threat, along with the threat of ISIL; climate change, of course, makes cascading threats even more (inaudible).  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton, the greatest national security threat?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Sanders, greatest national security threat?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Webb?  	True	False	1
COOPER	All right. We're going to take a short break. Do these candidates see eye to eye on an issue that is driving a big wedge between Republicans? That is next.  We'll be right back. [applause]  [commercial break]  	True	False	1
COOPER	And welcome back. We are live in Nevada, in Las Vegas, at the Wynn Resort for the first Democratic presidential debate. The questions continue.  We begin with Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you are going to be testifying before Congress next week about your e-mails. For the last eight months, you haven't been able to put this issue behind you. You dismissed it; you joked about it; you called it a mistake. What does that say about your ability to handle far more challenging crises as president?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary...  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton, Secretary Clinton, with all due respect, it's a little hard — I mean, isn't it a little bit hard to call this just a partisan issue? There's an FBI investigation, and President Obama himself just two days ago said this is a legitimate issue.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Thank you.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Sanders?  	True	False	1
COOPER	It's obviously very popular in this crowd, and it's — hold on. [applause]  I know that plays well in this room. But I got to be honest, Governor Chafee, for the record, on the campaign trail, you've said a different thing. You said this is a huge issue. Standing here in front of Secretary Clinton, are you willing to say that to her face?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?  	True	False	1
COOPER	"Governor — Governor... [applause]  Governor O'Malley... [applause]  Governor, it's popular in the room, but a lot of people do want to know these answers.  Governor O'Malley, you expressed concern on the campaign trail that the Democratic Party is, and I quote, ""being defined by Hillary Clinton's email scandal.""  You heard her answer, do you still feel that way tonight?  O'MALLEY: I believe that now that we're finally having debates, Anderson, that we don't have to be defined by the email scandal, and how long — what the FBI's asking about. Instead, we can talk about affordable college, making college debt free, and all the issues. Which is why — and I see the chair of the DNC here, look how glad we are actually to be talking about the issues that matter the most to people around the kitchen table.  We need to get wages to go up, college more affordable...  "	True	False	1
COOPER	...Thank you, governor.  O'MALLEY: ...we need to make American 100 percent clean electric by 2050.  	True	False	1
COOPER	I want to talk about issues of race in America, for that I want to start of with Don Lemon.  	True	False	1
COOPER	The question from Arthur...  	True	False	1
COOPER	...Do black lives matter, or do all lives matter? Let's put that question to Senator Sanders.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor O'Malley, the question from Arthur was do black lives matter, or do all lives matter?  O'MALLEY: Anderson, the point that the Black Lives Matter movement is making is a very, very legitimate and serious point, and that is that as a nation we have undervalued the lives of black lives, people of color.  When I ran for Mayor of Baltimore — and we we burying over 350 young men ever single year, mostly young, and poor, and black, and I said to our legislature, at the time when I appeared in front of them as a mayor, that if we were burying white, young, poor men in these number we would be marching in the streets and there would be a different reaction.  Black lives matter, and we have a lot of work to do to reform our criminal justice system, and to address race relations in our country. [applause]  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton, what would you do for African Americans in this country that President Obama couldn't?  	True	False	1
COOPER	...Thank you, Senator...  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator...  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Webb?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Thanks, sir.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Sanders, let's talk about income inequality. Wages and incomes are flat. You've argued that the gap between rich and poor is wider than at any time since the 1920s. We've had a Democratic president for seven years. What are you going to be able to do that President Obama didn't?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton...  [crosstalk]  	True	False	1
COOPER	I'll let you jump in a moment. Everybody will get in on this in a moment.  Secretary Clinton, how would you address this issue? In all candor, you and your husband are part of the one percent. How can you credibly represent the views of the middle class?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor O'Malley, (inaudible).  O'MALLEY: Yes. Anderson, I want to associate myself with many of the items that the senator from Vermont mentioned, and I actually did them in our state. We raised the minimum wage, passed the living wage, invested more in infrastructure, went four years in a row without a penny's increase in college tuition.  But there's another piece that Senator Sanders left out tonight, but he's been excellent about underscoring that. And that is that we need to separate the casino, speculative, mega-bank gambling that we have to insure with our money, from the commercial banking — namely, reinstating Glass-Steagall.  Secretary Clinton mentioned my support eight years ago. And Secretary, I was proud to support you eight years ago, but something happened in between, and that is, Anderson, a Wall Street crash that wiped out millions of jobs and millions of savings for families. And we are still just as vulnerable Paul Volcker says today.  We need to reinstate Glass-Steagall and that's a huge difference on this stage among us as candidates.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Just for viewers at home who may not be reading up on this, Glass-Steagall is the Depression-era banking law repealed in 1999 that prevented commercial banks from engaging in investment banking and insurance activities.  Secretary Clinton, he raises a fundamental difference on this stage. Senator Sanders wants to break up the big Wall Street banks. You don't. You say charge the banks more, continue to monitor them. Why is your plan better?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton just said that her policy is tougher than yours.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Why?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator...  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton, you have to be able to respond. He brought you up.  	True	False	1
COOPER	[inaudible]  	True	False	1
COOPER	Thank you. Thank you. Senator Sanders...  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor O'Malley? Where do you stand?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton...  O'MALLEY: ...our promise.  	True	False	1
COOPER	I have to let you respond. [applause]  	True	False	1
COOPER	Thank you.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Thank...  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Sanders... [applause]  Senator Sanders, in 2008, congressional leaders were told, without the 2008 bailout, the U.S. was possibly days away from a complete meltdown. Despite that, you still voted against it.  As president, would you stand by your principles if it risked the country's financial stability?  	True	False	1
COOPER	We're going to talk about that in a minute.  But, Senator Webb, I want to get you in. You have said neither party has the guts to take on Wall Street. Is the system rigged?  	True	False	1
COOPER	You agreed to these rules and you're wasting time. So if you would finish your answer, we'll move on.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor Chafee, you have attacked Secretary Clinton for being too close to Wall Street banks. In 1999 you voted for the very bill that made banks bigger.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Are you saying you didn't know what you were voting for?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Well, with all due respect, Governor...  	True	False	1
COOPER	... what does that say about you that you're casting a vote for something you weren't really sure about?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Thank you, Governor.  	True	False	1
COOPER	I want to bring in Dana Bash.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Dana?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Sanders, I want to bring it over to Juan Carlos Lopez from CNN en Espanol. We're obviously in Nevada. It's had the highest percentage of undocumented immigrants of any state in the country as of last year. Juan Carlos?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Webb...  O'MALLEY: ...immigration reform. It'll make wages go up in America $250 for every year...  	True	False	1
COOPER	...Thank you, Senator.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton?  	True	False	1
COOPER	...Secretary...  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton, let me ask you. Two of your rivals from your left, Governor O'Malley, and Senator Sanders, want to provide instate college tuition to undocumented immigrants. Where do you stand on that?  	True	False	1
COOPER	So, on the record, you believe that undocumented immigrants should get instate college tuition.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor O'Malley?  O'MALLEY: Anderson, we actually did this in my state of Maryland. We passed... [applause]  O'MALLEY: We passed a state version of the DREAM Act...  (CHEERING)  O'MALLEY: ...And a lot of the xenophobes, the immigrant haters like some that we've heard like, Donald Trump, that carnival barker in the Republican party...  (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)  O'MALLEY: Tried to mischaracterize it as free tuition for illegal immigrants. But, we took our case to the people when it was petitioned to referendum, and we won with 58 percent of the vote. The more our children learn, the more they will earn, and that's true of children who have yet to be naturalized...  	True	False	1
COOPER	...Senator...  O'MALLEY: ...but will become American citizens...  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Sanders, you talked about your record on the Veteran affairs committee. You served on that committee for the last eight years, including two years as its chairman while veterans died waiting for health care. You and Senator McCain ultimately addressed the issue with bi-partisan legislation. Why did it take 18 Inspector General reports, and a CNN investigation, and others, before you and your colleagues took action?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor Chafee, you and Hillary Clinton both voted for the Patriot Act which created the NSA surveillance program. You've emphasized civil liberties, privacy during your campaign. Aren't these two things in conflict?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Do you regret that vote?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton, do you regret your vote on the Patriot Act?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator — Senator Sanders, you're the only one on this stage who voted against the Patriot Act in 2001... [applause]  	True	False	1
COOPER	... and the reauthorization votes. Let me ask you, if elected, would you shut down the NSA surveillance program?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Would you shut down the NSA surveillance program?  	True	False	1
COOPER	You would, point blank.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor Chafee, Edward Snowden, is he a traitor or a hero?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Bring him home, no jail time?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton, hero or traitor?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Should he do jail time?  ClINTON: In addition — in addition, he stole very important information that has unfortunately fallen into a lot of the wrong hands. So I don't think he should be brought home without facing the music.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor O'Malley, Snowden? [applause]  O'MALLEY: Anderson, Snowden put a lot of Americans' lives at risk. Snowden broke the law. Whistleblowers do not run to Russia and try to get protection from Putin. If he really believes that, he should be back here.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Sanders, Edward Snowden?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Is he a hero?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Webb, Edward Snowden?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Another — another question for each of you, starting with Governor Chafee.  Name the one thing — the one way that your administration would not be a third term of President Obama.  	True	False	1
COOPER	President Obama's generals right now are suggesting keeping troops in Afghanistan after the time he wanted them pulled out. Would you keep them there?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor O'Malley, how would you be different than President Obama's administration?  O'MALLEY: I would follow through on the promise that the American people thought we made as Democratic Party, to protect the Main Street economy from recklessness on Wall Street. I would push to separate out these too-big-to-jail, too-big-to-fail banks, and put in place Glass-Steagall, a modern Glass-Steagall that creates a firewall so that this wreckage of our economy can never happen again.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton, how would you not be a third term of President Obama?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Is there a policy difference?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Sanders?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Webb, how would you not be a third term for Obama?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Sanders, he cited you. You don't hear a lot of Democratic presidential candidates talking about revolution. What do you mean?  	True	False	1
COOPER	And we want to — and we're going to talk more about climate change and environmental issues coming up. Some of the candidates have tried marijuana, as have pretty much — probably everybody in this room.  (LAUGHTER)  Others have not. Does that influence — does it influence their views on legalization? Find out that and others ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  	True	False	1
COOPER	And welcome back to this CNN Democratic presidential debate. It has been quite a night so far. We are in the final block of this debate. All the candidates are back, which I'm very happy to see.  (LAUGHTER)  	True	False	1
COOPER	It's a long story. Let's continue, shall we?  Secretary Clinton, welcome back.  	True	False	1
COOPER	That's right. Secretary Clinton, Governor O'Malley says the presidency is not a crown to be passed back and forth between two royal families. This year has been the year of the outsider in politics, just ask Bernie Sanders. Why should Democrats embrace an insider like yourself?  	True	False	1
COOPER	"Governor O'Malley, do you want to tell Secretary Clinton why she shouldn't get the crown?  O'MALLEY: Well, actually, you know, we had this conversation. And I will share with you that I've traveled all around the country, Anderson, and there's two phrases I keep hearing again and again and again. And they're the phrases ""new leadership"" and ""getting things done.""  We cannot be this dissatisfied with our gridlocked national politics and an economy where 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago, and think that a resort to old names is going to move us forward.  I respect what Secretary Clinton and her husband have done for our country. But our country needs new leadership to move forward.  "	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton, you have to be able to respond, if you want.  	True	False	1
COOPER	(inaudible). [applause]  Senator Sanders, does she have the right stuff?  	True	False	1
COOPER	we've got — we — a lot of questions we've got about climate change, and we're gonna go to Don Lemon. Don?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor...  O'MALLEY: We can do it.  	True	False	1
COOPER	...Governor O'Malley, thank you very much. [applause]  Senator Webb, you have a very different view than just about anybody else on this stage, and unlike a lot of Democrats. You're pro-coal, you're pro-offshore drilling, you're pro-Keystone pipeline. Are — again, are you — the question is, are you out of step with the Democratic party?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Sanders, are you tougher on — on climate change than Secretary Clinton?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator — thank you, Senator.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton, I want you to be able to respond, then I'm gonna go to (ph) (inaudible).  	True	False	1
COOPER	Thank you.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Dana Bash?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Thank you. Senator Sanders?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor O'Malley?  O'MALLEY: Anderson, in our state, we actually expanded family leave. And I have to agree with Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders. Look, the genius of our nation is that we find ways in every generation to include more of our people more fully in the economic life of our country, and we need to do that for our families, and especially so that women aren't penalized in having to drop out of the workforce. My wife, Katie, is here with our four kids. And, man, that was a juggle when we had little kids and — and keeping jobs and moving forwards. We would be a stronger nation economically if we had paid family leave.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor, thank you. The issue now, particularly in this state, is recreational marijuana. I want to go to Juan Carlos Lopez.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton, thank you. I want to go to Don Lemon with another Facebook question.  	True	False	1
COOPER	We're going to hear from all the candidates coming up. We're going to take a short break. More from the candidates in a moment. [applause]  [commercial break]  	True	False	1
COOPER	"And welcome back to the final round of the CNN Democratic presidential debate.  This is a question to each of you. Each of you, by the way, are going to have closing statements to make. Each of you will have 90 seconds. But a final question to each of you. If you can, just try to — 15 seconds if you can.  Governor Chafee, Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said, ""I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."" You've all made a few people upset over your political careers. Which enemy are you most proud of? [laughter]  "	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor O'Malley?  O'MALLEY: The National Rifle Association. [applause]  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Sanders?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Webb?  	True	False	1
COOPER	All right. Time for closing statements. Each of you will have 90 seconds.  Governor Chafee, let's begin with you.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor Chafee, thank you very much. Senator Webb, your final statement for 90 seconds.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Senator Webb, thank you very much.  Governor O'Malley, you have 90 seconds.  O'MALLEY: Anderson, thank you.  I am very, very grateful to have been able to be on this stage with this distinguished group of candidates tonight. And what you heard tonight, Anderson, was a very, very — and all of you watching at home — was a very, very different debate than from the sort of debate you heard from the two presidential Republican debates. [applause]  On this stage — on this stage, you didn't hear anyone denigrate women, you didn't hear anyone make racist comments about new American immigrants, you didn't hear anyone speak ill of another American because of their religious belief.  What you heard instead on this stage tonight was an honest search for the answers that will move our country forward, to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050, to take the actions that we have always taken as Americans so that we can actually attack injustice in our country, employ more of our people, rebuild our cities and towns, educate our children at higher and better levels, and include more of our people in the economic, social, and political life of our country.  I truly believe that we are standing on the threshold of a new era of American progress. Unless you've become discouraged about our gridlock in Congress, talk to our young people under 30, because you'll never find among them people that want to bash immigrants or people that want to deny rights to gay couples. [applause]  That tells me we are moving to a more connected, generous, and compassionate place, and we need to speak to the goodness within our country. [applause]  	True	False	1
COOPER	Governor O'Malley, thank you very much.  Senator Sanders, final, closing thoughts, 90 seconds.  	True	False	1
COOPER	Secretary Clinton?  	True	False	1
COOPER	Well, that does it for this Democratic presidential debate. On behalf of everyone at CNN, we want to thank the candidates, our debate partners at Facebook, the Wynn Resort, and the Democratic National Committee. Thanks also to Dana Bash, Juan Carlos Lopez, and Don Lemon. We'll be back in Las Vegas December 15th, when CNN hosts our next Republican presidential debate. That will be moderated by my colleague, Wolf Blitzer.	True	False	1
MADDOW	We are super excited to be here at the University of New Hampshire. Tonight, this is the first time that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have squared off exactly like this. Face-to-face, just one-on-one, just the two of them.  	True	False	5
MADDOW	And we do hope that the candidates will take this opportunity to show us the distinctions—show us the differences between them. That's the whole reason that we're here tonight.  We're not here for talking points. We're to learn about the difference between the candidates. And with that, let's get going. Please join us in welcoming Secretary Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders. [applause]  	True	False	5
MADDOW	And with that, that's it. We're going to begin with 60- second opening statements from each of the candidates. And as agreed to in advance by the two campaigns, we're going to begin tonight with Senator Sanders.  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders is campaigning against you now, at this point in the campaign, basically arguing that you are not progressive enough to be the Democratic nominee. He has said that if you voted for the Iraq war, if you are in favor of the death penalty, if you wobbled on things like the Keystone Pipeline or TPP, if you said single payer health care could never happen, then you're too far to the right of the Democratic Party to be the party's standard bearer.  Given those policy positions, why should liberal Democrats support you and not Senator Sanders?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Senator Sanders, have you established a list of what it means to be a progressive that is unrealistic?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Thank you Senator. [applause]  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Senator Sanders, as a Vermonter, you have almost a home state advantage here in New Hampshire. But back home across the border, you also have a long history of running against Democrats as a third-party candidate, for governor, Senate, for Congress.  In 1988 your candidacy as a third-party candidate arguably cost the Democrats a congressional seat and sent a Republican instead.  How can you lead the Democratic Party nationally when you have not been a member of the Democratic Party until very recently?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Secretary Clinton.  	True	False	5
MADDOW	So, Senator, to that point, Secretary Clinton is raising the issue of endorsements by your home state Democrats. She's implying that that says something about the people who know you best.  	True	False	5
MADDOW	How do you see it?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Secretary.  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Senator Sanders, you'll have 30 seconds to respond to that.  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, obviously we've touched a nerve. We're going to be back with more on this subject, and much more, right after this. Stay with us. [applause]  [commercial break]  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, on the issue of Wall Street...  	True	False	5
MADDOW	... on the issue of Wall Street, when our reporters go out and talk to people on the ground in the early states, what they tell us over and over again when they find voters who are leaning toward Senator Sanders rather than yourself is that the most frequent area of concern that they hear from those voters is the issue of Wall Street and whether or not you are too close to Wall Street.  Last night, when you were asked about speaking fees and the amount of speaking fees you got from Goldman Sachs speeches, you said that's what they offered.  Have you been too dismissive of voters' concerns about this issue in your own campaign and your own career?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Senator Sanders, you have been a critic of Secretary Clinton taking those speaking fees and having donations from Wall Street. What about her defense of her record?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Senator Sanders, let me turn to, I think, where this direction is heading anyway, which is the broader issue of big business and power in our political system. You on the campaign trail have railed against big name American corporations like Boeing, and General Electric, and Wal Mart. But, some big businesses in this country have also been part of advancing progressive goals like that nationwide initiative to expand employment opportunities for veterans. That was all about cooperation between the Obama administration and some very big business. The Affordable Care Act, some of the thorniest problems in that bill were worked out in cooperation with big business in order to accomplish progressive goals.  Could you work with them, or have you made enemies of big business in this country with the way you've approached them in this campaign?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Senator Sanders, thank you.  And with that, we're going to take a break.  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Welcome back—welcome back to the Democratic candidates' debate. We're going to be talking about America in the world, both in terms of some trade issues, but also national security.  And Secretary Clinton, we're going to start with you. There are more than 4,000 American troops back in Iraq right now as part of the fight against ISIS. It has been 15 straight years of wars and multiple deployments for America's military families, who have borne such a disproportionate burden.  Is President Obama right to keep escalating the number of U.S. troops that's fighting ISIS right now?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	To be clear, to the specific question, if that strategic goal that you're describing requires considerably more of Americans—an ever-increasing number of Americans in Iraq and maybe in Syria, are you OK with the numbers increasing?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Thank you, Madam Secretary.  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, at the—at the last Democratic debate in Charleston—I want to get specific here—Senator Sanders called for moving as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran. Your campaign has criticized him for saying that. Now that he's standing next to you here on this stage, can you explain why the U.S. shouldn't try to normalize relations in Iran in your view?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, I want to ask you about a national security issue that is closer to home. There are thousands of veterans, over 100,000 veterans living in the state of New Hampshire.  If either one of you is nominated as the Democratic Party's nominee, you will likely face a Republican opponent in the general election who wants to privatize or even abolish big parts of the V.A. It's a newly popular idea in conservative politics.  How will you win the argument on that issue given the problems that have been exposed at the V.A. in the last few years? What's your argument that the V.A. should still exist and should not be privatized?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Senator Sanders, you, as a congressional leader on veterans issues and the Veterans Committee, you've worked in a very bipartisan way with Senator John McCain and others on veterans issues. Is the right contour of the fight, the way she's talking about this issue?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Thank you, Senator.  Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, we're going to take another break. We'll be talking about Social Security and some of those other issues when we come back. [applause]  [commercial break]  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Senator—Senator Sanders, in 1964...  	True	False	5
MADDOW	In 1964, I heard that the Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater, who was the hero of the conservative movement. He was, however, far to the right of most of that party. In 1972, the Democrats nominated George McGovern, who was a hero of liberals in the antiwar movement, but he was to the left of his party's mainstream.  Both of those nominees made activists very excited, and they both got destroyed in the general election. Even Democrats who love you worry about your fate in a general election. And I know you have good head-to-head polling numbers against Republican frontrunners right now. We know that. But do you have a general election strategy that is different than the way you're running right now to try to get the nomination?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, your campaign surrogates, and people who have endorsed you, have suggested that or even said that if Senator Sanders is the nominee, that Democrats will suffer nationwide and the chances will go down of Democrats holding onto the White House. With him here standing next to you, can you tell us whether or not you believe he would win the general election if he were nominated?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Senator Sanders, thank you. Senator, in December, one of your campaign staffers was fired from your campaign for taking voter data essentially from the Clinton campaign. You apologized for that when the incident was made public.  Your campaign has now been criticized for its operatives essentially impersonating culinary union members wearing union pins in Nevada, and the Nashua Telegraph has complained recently that you falsely implied in an advertisement that they had endorsed you when they did not.  None of these issues obviously is the end of the world, but they all are of a piece. Are you in some sense losing control of your campaign?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Just to follow up on that, the title of the ad in question was Endorsement.  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, do you want 30 seconds on that issue?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	And with that, we will [inaudible]. [applause]  [commercial break]  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Welcome back to the University of New Hampshire, and the Democratic candidates' debate.  Secretary Clinton, on the issue of the death penalty, here in New Hampshire, the one person who is on death row is there for killing a police officer. It's a crime that has caused anguish in this state, both among death penalty opponents and death penalty supporters.  The last time I had the chance to talk with you on this issue, on the death penalty, you said that capital punishment has a place in a very few federal cases, but you also said you would breathe a sigh of relief if the Supreme Court abolished the death penalty nationwide. Tonight, do you still support capital punishment, even if you do so reluctantly?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Senator Sanders, you have singled out the death penalty, and Senator Clinton's support for the death penalty, as an issue that makes it hard to consider as progressive in your mind...  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Another issue related to the proper role of government, and in this case, specifically the role of government between the federal government and the states. I want to talk for a moment about the issue of Flint, Michigan. On the Flint lead poisoning disaster, you have both been highly critical of Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan, and how the state in Michigan both caused the lead poisoning problem, and has not acted fast enough to fix it. You have both been outspoken on that.  The fact is that Michigan though has not fixed it. There is no door to door delivery of clean water in Flint even today. Not a single lead pipe has been replaced in Flint, even today. If the state is failing, would you, Secretary Clinton, would you as President order a federal response to get it right over and above the wishes of the state?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Senator Sanders are there things the President could be doing? President Obama could be ordering, done, right now, in Flint, Michigan that are not being done that you as President would do?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Senator, thank you.  	True	False	5
MADDOW	The home stretch.  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, Republicans, particularly in campaign years, often talk about which departments of government—which agencies of government they would get rid of if they were elected president. The EPA, the Department of Education, the Commerce Department, oops—is—is there a department of government that you would get rid of? Or is there a whole new one that you would create?  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Thank you very much. Thank you. [applause]  	True	False	5
MADDOW	We also want to thank our host, the University of New Hampshire, and the people of New Hampshire. You guys get to vote in just five days. I can't wait to see how it turns out. Don't screw up.  	True	False	5
MADDOW	Thank you. [applause]	True	False	5
HARMAN	Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina.  Dr. Carson?  	False	True	3
TAPPER	I'm Jake Tapper. We're live at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California for the main event. Round 2 of CNN's presidential debate starts now.  The eleven leading Republican candidates for president are at their podiums. They are ready to face off, and if you've been watching this race, you know anything could happen over the next few hours.  To viewers who are just joining us, welcome to the Air Force One Pavilion of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Our thanks to the staff here and especially to former first lady Nancy Reagan for this impressive setting with Ronald Reagan's presidential plane as our backdrop. [applause]  This debate is airing on CNN networks in the United States and around the world. It's also being broadcast on the Salem Radio Network. I know everyone is very eager to get started.  But first, I want to explain the ground rules tonight. My name is Jake Tapper. I'll be the moderator. I will be joined in the questioning by Salem Radio Network talk show host Hugh Hewitt. He worked in the Reagan administration for six years. And by CNN's chief political correspondent Dana Bash.  I will ask follow-up questions, I will attempt to guide the discussion. Candidates, I will try to make sure each of you gets your fair share of questions. You'll have one minute to answer and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals. I'll give you time to respond if you've been singled out for criticism.  Our viewers should know we have timing lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when their time is up. These 11 Republicans are positioned on the stage based on their ranking in recent national polls.  Our goal for this evening is a debate. A true debate, with candidates addressing each other in areas where they differ. Where they disagree — on policy, on politics, on leadership. Now, let's begin.  I'd like to invite each candidate to take 30 seconds to introduce him or herself to our audience. First to you, Senator Paul.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Senator Cruz?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	"Thank you one and all for being here. There are many important policy issues facing our nation. We're going to get to many of them tonight, but I do want to start off with some current events in the news, and also some of the comments the candidates have recently made on the campaign trail.  Mrs. Fiorina, I want to start with you. Fellow Republican candidate, and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, has suggested that your party's frontrunner, Mr. Donald Trump, would be dangerous as President. He said he wouldn't want, quote, ""such a hot head with his finger on the nuclear codes.""  You, as well, have raised concerns about Mr. Trump's temperament.  You've dismissed him as an entertainer. Would you feel comfortable with Donald trump's finger on the nuclear codes?  "	False	True	2
TAPPER	You didn't answer my question. Would you feel comfortable with Donald Trump's finger on the nuclear codes? It's an issue that one of your fellow candidates has raised.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Mr. Trump? [applause]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Mr. — Senator Paul, your name has been invoked.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Mr. Trump? [applause]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	I want to — I want to give Mr. Trump...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	... Mr. Trump, I want to give you another chance — Mr. Trump, I want to give you a chance to respond to something that your rival to your left, Governor Bush, said.  Governor Bush told me last week when I read him the quote from Governor Jindal that he agrees you're not a serious candidate.  Tell Governor Bush why you are a serious candidate and what your qualifications are to be commander-in-chief.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Bush, would you feel comfortable with Donald Trump's finger on the nuclear codes?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Walker?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Let's move on. [applause]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	A phenomenon going on in the race right now is the political...  OK, Governor Kasich, go ahead.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	We have a lot of issues coming up, sir.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	"We are getting to the issues, sir. [applause]  Phenomenon going on in the race is the political outsiders in the race, Dr. Carson, Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina, all together, have majority support in the polls.  Governor Christie, I want to ask you about something that Dr. Carson said the other day.  Dr. Carson said campaigning is easier for him, because he's not a politician. He can just tell the truth, therefore, while politicians, quote, ""Have their finger in the air to see and do what is politically expedient.""  Governor Christie, tell Dr. Carson, is that a fair description of you?  "	False	True	2
TAPPER	Well, let's find out. Thank you.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor Christie.  Dr. Carson, who were you thinking about on this stage when you said that?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	And more broadly, is experience in government not important for a president to have?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Dr. Carson.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you. Thank you Ms. Fiorina. [applause]  Governor Bush, in addition to the fact that he's an outsider, one of the reasons Mr. Trump is a frontrunner, Republican voters say, is because they like the fact that he is not bought and paid for by wealthy donors. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that the $100 million you've raised for your campaign makes you a puppet for your donors. Are you?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Is there anything else you want to say about this?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor —  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Sure Dr. Carson.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	"Thank you, Dr. Carson. Let's move to Russia if we could.  Russia is sending troops and tanks into Syria right now to prop up a U.S. enemy, Bashar al-Assad. President Obama's incoming top general says, quote, ""Russia presents the greatest threat to our national security.""  Mr. Trump, you say you can do business with President Vladimir Putin, you say you will get along, quote, ""very well."" What would you do right now if you were president, to get the Russians out of Syria?  "	False	True	2
TAPPER	So, you — just to clarify, the only answer I heard to the question I asked is that you would — you would reach out to Vladimir Putin, and you would do what? You would...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	"Senator Rubio, you've taken a very different approach to the — the question of Russia. You've called Vladimir Putin a, quote, ""gangster.""  Why would President Rubio's approach be more effective than President Trump's?  "	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Senator Rubio.  [crosstalk]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	I want to bring in Carly Fiorina. [applause]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Ms. Fiorina, you have met...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	...yeah, you've met Vladimir Putin. Yes.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	"Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.  While you're — while you brought up the subject of General Suleimani of the Quds forces from Iran, the next president, no matter who he or she may be, will inherit President Obama's Iran deal.  Senator Cruz, Governor Kasich says that anyone who is promising to rip up the Iran deal on day one, as you have promised to do, is, quote, ""inexperienced,"" and, quote, ""playing to a crowd."" Respond to Governor Kasich, please.  "	False	True	2
TAPPER	Why is that not, as Governor Kasich says, playing to the crowd and an example of you being inexperienced?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Kasich...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	...Did Senator Cruz just play to the crowd?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	...Thank you, Governor. I want to go to Senator Paul.  TRUMP(?): ...Slow (ph) and steady, [inaudible] chicken...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	I want to go to Senator Paul. Senator Paul, the White House is rolling out the red carpet next week for the President of China, President Xi. Governor Walker says that President Obama should cancel the state dinner because of China's currency manipulation, and because of China's alleged cyber attacks against the United States.  Is Governor Walker right?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Walker, Senator Paul seemed to suggest... [applause]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	...that canceling the state dinner would be rash, and reckless.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	...Governor Bush...  CRUZ(?): ...Jake...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Bush, your father was the chief diplomatic envoy to China back when Nixon opened relations to China. Is Scott Walker's approach the right one, canceling the state dinner?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	I want to turn...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	...I want to turn to Governor Huckabee who has been very patient. Somebody had to be 11th, and he is, but, I do want to change the subject to the event that you had...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	... however you want, but I want to ask this question.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	All right, sir, go ahead.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	OK.  (UNKNOWN): Jake, I'd like to...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	We're going to turn now to Hugh Hewitt, from Salem Radio Network.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Senator Paul. [applause]  I want to turn now to my colleague Dana Bash.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	That would be fair, you're right. You're the third senator.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	We're going to go to Dana Bash...  [crosstalk]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Senator Cruz?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Senator. I want to...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	... turn back to Governor Huckabee...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	"I want to turn back to Governor Huckabee.  Governor Huckabee, last week, you held a rally for a county clerk in Kentucky who was jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, as I don't need to tell you.  You've called what happened to Kim Davis, that clerk, ""an example of the criminalization of Christianity."" There are several people on the stage who disagree with you.  Governor Bush, for example, says that that clerk is sworn to uphold the law. Is Governor Bush on the wrong side of the criminalization of Christianity?  "	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Well, I'm not telling you that, Governor. But Governor Bush is, because he — because he disagrees. He thinks that Kim Davis swore to uphold the law.  You disagree? You're not — you don't...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	OK. Please do.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	You did...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	"Governor, you said, quote, ""she is sworn to uphold the law.""  "	False	True	2
TAPPER	Let me go to my colleague Dana Bash, who has a question.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	"Dana, I want to continue on the subject.  Governor Bush, you recently said while discussing Planned Parenthood, quote, you're ""not sure we need a half billion for women's health issues."" Now you've since said that you misspoke, you didn't mean to say ""women's health issues.""  But Donald Trump said that quote, that comment, which Hillary Clinton did seize upon immediately, will haunt you the same way Mitt Romney's 47 percent video haunted him.  Tell Donald Trump why he's wrong.  "	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor Bush.  Donald Trump, let me just...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	"The quote was, ""I'm not sure we need half a billion dollars for women's health issues."" He said he misspoke. You said that that's going to haunt him. Why do you think that?  "	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Bush?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	I want to — we're going to get to —  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	"We're going to — we're going to get to many of these issues. This — we're still in the first block, believe it or not. We're going to get to many of these issues, but before we end this block, Ms. Fiorina, I do want to ask you about this.  In an interview last week in Rolling Stone magazine, Donald Trump said the following about you. Quote, ""Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?"" Mr. Trump later said he was talking about your persona, not your appearance. Please feel free to respond what you think about his persona. [laughter]  "	False	True	2
TAPPER	All right. On that note, in less than two minutes — we're going to take a very quick break. In less than two minutes, the most contentious issue on the campaign trail. And the candidates on the stage are split over how to handle it. That's coming up next.  Please give some applause to the candidates. [applause]  [commercial break]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	"Welcome to CNN's Republican Presidential Debate. No topic perhaps has been more combustible in this campaign than the issue of immigration.  Mr. Trump, you have called for deporting every undocumented immigrant, Governor Christie has said, quote, ""There are not enough law enforcement officers — local, county, state and federal combined — to forcibly deport 11 to 12 million people.""  Tell Governor Christie how much your plan will cost, and how you will get it done.  "	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Christie, you and I have talked about this in an interview. You say that his big wall, his plan to deport 11 to 12 million undocumented immigrants, it sounds great, but it's never going to happen.  Tell him why you're skeptical of his plans?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor Christie...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	"I want to bring in Dr. Carson because he too has been skeptical of your plan to immediately deport 11 to 12 million illegal immigrants. He said, quote, ""People who say that have no idea what this entails.""  Why do you say that, Dr. Carson?  "	False	True	2
TAPPER	...Dr. Carson...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	"With all due respect, you said about Donald Trump's plan to deport 11 to 12 million undocumented immigrants, ""People who say that have no idea what this entails.""  Why not?  "	False	True	2
TAPPER	...let's continue the conversation about illegal immigration with Dana Bash.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Senator Rubio. [applause]  Senator Cruz — Senator Cruz, this week, we learned more about Dr. Carson's plan for the 11 million to 12 million undocumented immigrants in this country.  Dr. Carson proposed giving these undocumented immigrants a six- month grace period to pay back taxes then to let them become guest workers and only to deport people who failed to do that.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Well, how would you say it, sir? I was just reading the Wall Street Journal quote, but please tell us.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	OK, from the horse's mouth, Senator Cruz, does that fit your definition of amnesty?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.  Senator Rubio...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	... I'm not sure...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	We'll come back to you — we'll come back to you in one second, sir.  But Senator Rubio, I'm not sure exactly whose plan he's — he's saying is — constitutes amnesty, but I know he has said it about your plan in the past, so I want to give you a chance to respond, then, Dr. Carson, we'll come to you.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.  Senator — Dr. Carson... [applause] ... I want to give you 30 seconds. I'd like you to answer the question.  Senator Cruz describes plans such as yours as amnesty. Why is your plan not amnesty?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Dr. Carson. I want to talk about the issue of birthright citizenship, which — which has emerged since the first debate as — as an a — a major issue in this campaign.  Mr. Trump, you say that babies born in the United States to undocumented immigrants should not any longer get automatic American citizenship. Ms. Fiorina says that you are pandering on this issue and acting like the politicians that you rail against. What's your message to Ms. Fiorina on birthright citizenship?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Ms. Fiorina, the vast majority of countries do not have birthright citizenship... [applause] ...Donald Trump is right about that. Why is it pandering when he's — he says this?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Ms. Fiorina...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Please.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Ms. Fiorina. Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Paul...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Senator Paul, I want to bring you in. Where — where do you stand on the issue of birthright citizenship?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	"All right. Senator Paul, thank you so much. Let's turn to a new topic. We've received a lot of questions on social media about the economy and about jobs. We have two CEOs on stage right now.  Ms. Fiorina, you were CEO of Hewlett Packard. Donald Trump says you, quote, ""ran HP into the ground,"" you laid off tens of thousands of people, you got viciously fired.  For voters looking to somebody with private-sector experience to create American jobs, why should they pick you and not Donald Trump?  "	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Mr. Trump — Mr. Trump, why would you be better at creating jobs than Carly Fiorina?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Ms. Fiorina, I want to give you a chance to respond.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Mr. Trump.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Mr. Trump.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Christie's name has been invoked. I'd like to give him a 30 second opportunity.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Ms. Fiorina, I want to give you  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Kasich, I'm coming to you next, but Ms. Fiorina's name was mentioned, and I have to give her the opportunity to respond if she wants it.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.  Governor Kasich, I want to come — I'm coming to you. I'm coming to you. Let me ask the question. You can use the time however you want.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Donald Trump says that the hedge fund guys are getting away with murder by paying a lower tax rate. He wants to raise the taxes of hedge fund managers, as does Governor Bush. Do you agree?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor Kasich.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Huckabee, I want to bring you in on the question of hedge fund managers and taxing them. You have said that you are bothered by the fact that hedge fund managers pay such a low tax rate and make 2,500 times what people who work for them make.  Do you agree with what Donald Trump and Governor Bush have proposed, raising their tax rates?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.  Dr. Carson, you support scrapping the entire tax code and replacing it with a flat tax based on the principal on tithing from the Bible. If you make $10 billion, you pay $1 billion in taxes, if you make $10, you pay $1 in taxes.  Donald Trump believes in progressive taxation. He says it's not right that rich people pay the same as the poor. Tell Donald Trump why his ideas on taxes are wrong.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Mr. Trump...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	...What do you think of the flat tax? Do you think it's fair?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Paul?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Walker, I want to go to you. Dr. Carson wants to raise the Federal Minimum Wage, you have called it a lame idea. Why is raising the Federal Minimum Wage lame?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	...Thank you, Governor...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	...Thank you, Governor...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Dr. Carson, Governor Walker didn't really answer the question, but I'll let you respond. He called raising the Federal Minimum Wage lame, what do you think of that?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Dr. Carson...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Let me bring in our partner from Salem Radio Network, Hugh Hewitt.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	"Welcome back to CNN's Republican Presidential Debate. Let's turn to some issues now in foreign policy.  Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio said it was, quote, ""very concerning to him"" that in a recent interview you didn't seem to know the details about some of the enemies the U.S. faces. Rubio said, if you don't know the answers to those questions, you will not be able to serve as commander-in-chief.  Please respond to Senator Rubio.  "	False	True	2
TAPPER	Senator Rubio?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Mr. Trump? Senator Rubio seemed to be suggesting that you don't know information that...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	All right. Senator Rubio.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	But are you saying that you have the knowledge to be the president that Mr. Trump does not have?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Mr. Trump?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Senator Rubio, he did invoke your absentee record in the Senate.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Senator Rubio. I want to turn now to Hugh Hewitt.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Senator...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Senator Paul?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Senator Paul...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Senator Paul...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Senator Paul...[crosstalk]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	I understand that Governor Bush's name has been invoked, and then we can go to you, Senator Rubio.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.  Senator Rubio?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Dr. Carson?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Dr. Carson.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	I mean, it is interesting that you say that, because I want to ask Governor Christie about something else that you have said.  Governor Christie, we just marked the 14th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Now Dr. Carson has said that if he had been president at the time, the United States would not have gone to war in Afghanistan. What does that say to you about how Dr. Carson would respond as president if America were attacked again?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Dr. Carson?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	... Governor Christie.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Dr. Carson?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Dr. Carson.  	False	True	2

TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.  Governor Huckabee. [applause]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, governor, I want to turn to ISIS. Governor Walker...[crosstalk]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Walker, there is a big debate now, we have been talking about ISIS here and there in this discussion, there a big debate right now about whether or not to send more U.S. troops to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria.  In the first debate earlier this evening, Senator Lindsey Graham argued that candidates are only serious about fighting ISIS if they're willing to send 10,000 U.S. troops to Iraq, 10,000 U.S. troops as part of a coalition to Syria.  Governor Walker, you say, you just told me a few days ago that the 3,000 U.S. troops there right now are enough, as long as the rules of engagement are changed.  What do you know that Senator Graham doesn't know?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.  Senator Paul, I want to go to you, because you have said that the boots on the ground to fight ISIS need to be Arab boots. We just learned today that despite the Obama administration spending $500 million to help create those Arab boots, there are only four or five U.S. trained fighters in Syria fighting ISIS.  What does that say to you about the effectiveness of the idea of the boots on the ground need to be Arab boots?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Senator. [applause]  We're going to turn to some domestic issues now. I want to bring in my colleague, Dana Bash.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Sure....  	False	True	2
TAPPER	...Thank you, Governor...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	...Thank you, Governor. Dana Bash...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	...Thank you, we're going to turn now to domestic issues with Dana Bash.  	False	True	2

TAPPER	...Governor Bush...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	...I want to let you respond.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor...  ...And, that's what we should do, and I hope I'll be working members of the United States Senate to fight hard for the passage of people that have that kind of qualification.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Senator Cruz, 30 seconds.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Semator.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Senator. [applause]  Governor Huckabee, I want to bring you in very quickly if you could. Will you have a litmus test when it comes to appointing Supreme Court nominees?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor. We're going to take a quick break. Coming up, one of the hottest questions that you have been asking us via social media. We will pose it to the candidates. That's coming up right after this. [applause]  [commercial break]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	"Welcome back to CNN's Republican presidential debate at the Reagan Library here in Simi Valley — Simi Valley, California.  Many people on social media wanted us to ask about marijuana legalization. Senator Paul, Governor Christie recently said, quote, ""if you're getting high in Colorado today,"" where marijuana has been legalized, ""enjoy it until January 2017, because I will enforce the federal laws against marijuana."" Will you?  "	False	True	2
TAPPER	I want to give that — I want to give the person that you called a hypocrite an opportunity to respond. Do you want to identify that person?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Is there somebody you were specifically thinking of?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	That's what I though, but I wanted [inaudible] to say it.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	OK.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Bush, please.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	I want to go right now — I want to go right now...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	That's true. Go ahead, Christie, please.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	You may respond, and then I'll bring in you, Ms. Fiorina. [applause]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Yes, Senator Paul. [applause]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	I want to bring in Ms. Fiorina — I want to bring in Ms. Fiorina on this issue.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Hugh — Hugh, I'd like to... [applause]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	I'd like to turn it over — I'd like to turn to Dana Bush.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.  [crosstalk]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	I'm coming to you right now on a separate issue, sir. We received...  (UNKNOWN): Well, I want to talk about this issue for a moment.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	We received a lot of questions from social media about climate change.  Senator Rubio, Ronald Reagan's secretary of state, George Shultz, reminds us that when Reagan was president he faced a similar situation to the one that we're facing now. There were dire warnings from the mass consensus of the scientific community about the ozone layer shrinking.  Shultz says Ronald Reagan urged skeptics in industry to come up with a plan. He said, do it as an insurance policy in case the scientists are right. The scientists were right. Reagan and his approach worked.  Secretary Shultz asks, why not take out an insurance policy and approach climate change the Reagan way?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	I'm citing George Shultz.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Christie, you have said that climate change is real, and that humans help contribute to it. Without getting into the issue of China versus the United States, which I understand you've talked about before, what do you make of skeptics of climate change such as Senator Rubio?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Just for the record, I was citing Secretary of State George Shultz, Ronald Reagan's secretary of state who I don't think anybody would call him left-wing.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	I called you a skeptic.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	I want to go another question right now.  [crosstalk]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.  [crosstalk]  [crosstalk]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	I'm turning to...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	...I'm turning to another — I'm turning to another issue right now. Senator Cruz. Well, I think we've heard from several this evening.  A backlash against vaccines was blamed for a measles outbreak here in California. Dr. Carson, Donald Trump has publicly and repeatedly linked vaccines, childhood vaccines, to autism, which, as you know, the medical community adamantly disputes.  You're a pediatric neurosurgeon. Should Mr. Trump stop saying this?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Should he stop saying it? Should he stop saying that vaccines cause autism?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Mr. Trump, as president, you would...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	I'm going right to you.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Mr. Trump, as president, you would be in charge of the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health, both of which say you are wrong. How would you handle this as president?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Dr. — Dr. Carson?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Dr. Carson, you just heard his medical take. [laughter]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Dr. Paul? Dr. Paul, I'd like to bring you in.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Alright, thank you so much...  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Coming up — I'm sorry, Governor Huckabee, please.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	We have to take another quick break. Coming up, Ronald Reagan looming large over this debate. So how Reaganesque exactly are these Republicans? We will find out next. [applause]  [commercial break]  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Welcome back to CNN's Republican Presidential Debate at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California. We have a few last questions for you. Two of them a little lighthearted, the other one more serious. We'll start with one of the more light questions. Senator Paul, I'm going to start with you and we're just going to go down the line.  Earlier this year, the Treasury Department announced that a woman will appear on the $10 bill. What woman would you like to see on the $10 bill?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Huckabee?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Senator Paul (sic).  	False	True	2
TAPPER	I'm sorry. Senator Rubio?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Just the senators.  	False	True	2

TAPPER	Mrs. Fiorina.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Kasich.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Christie.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	"Alright. Some good entries if anybody at the mint was listening. Here's the next lighthearted question, you all know that the United States Secret Service uses codenames for the president, and his family. Ronald Reagan's codename, for example, was, ""Rawhide"", an homage to his performances in Westerns. Nancy Reagan's was, ""Rainbow"".  You don't have to come up the one for your spouse, but, what would you want, Governor Christie, I'll start with you, your Secret Service codename to be. [laughter]  "	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Walker?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Mr. Trump?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Dr. Carson?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Senator Cruz?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Senator Rubio?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Governor Huckabee.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	Senator Paul.  	False	True	2
TAPPER	That's a mouthful, but OK. [laughter]  OK, here's the more serious question, Ronald Reagan, the 40th President, used the plane behind you to accomplish a great many things. Perhaps, most notably, to challenge Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the wall, and ultimately, to make peace with the USSR.  How will the world look different once your Air Force One is parked in the hangar of your presidential library?  Senator Paul?  	False	True	2
TAPPER	That concludes this Republican presidential debate. On behalf of everyone here at CNN, we want to thank the candidates, the Reagan Library, and the Republican National Committee. Thank you, also, to Hugh Hewitt and Dana Bash.  The next presidential debate will also be right here on CNN, among the Democratic candidates, who will face off for the first time on October the 13th. That debate, a partnership with Facebook, will be moderated by my colleague, Anderson Cooper.  And Anderson picks up our coverage of tonight's debate right now. Before I throw to Anderson, let's have one final round of applause for the candidates.	False	True	2
HARWOOD	Mr. Trump, you've done very well in this campaign so far by promising to build a wall and make another country pay for it.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Send 11 million people out of the country. Cut taxes $10 trillion without increasing the deficit.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	And make Americans better off because your greatness would replace the stupidity and incompetence of others.   	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Let's be honest.  (LAUGHTER)  Is this a comic book version of a presidential campaign?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	We're at the 60 seconds.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	We're at 60 seconds, but I gotta ask you, you talked about your tax plan. You say that it would not increase the deficit because you cut taxes $10 trillion in the economy would take off like...  (CROSSTALK)  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Hold on, hold on. The economy would take off like a rocket ship.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	I talked to economic advisers who have served presidents of both parties. They said that you have as chance of cutting taxes that much without increasing the deficit as you would of flying away from that podium by flapping your arms.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	The Tax Foundation says -- has looked at all of our plans and -- and his creates, even with the dynamic effect, $8 trillion dollar deficit... QUICK: Gentlemen -- we'll -- we'll get back to this -- just a minute -- just a minute we're gonna continue this.  I wanna talk taxes...  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Governor Kasich, hold it, I'm coming to you right now. The...  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Well, I'm asking you about this.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	I'm about to ask you about this.  That is, you had some very strong words to say yesterday about what's happening in your party and what you're hearing from the two gentlemen we've just heard from. Would you repeat it?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Well, let's just get more pointed about it. You said yesterday that you were hearing proposals that were just crazy from your colleagues.  Who were you talking about?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Hold on. I think there's a -- I've got question for --  (CROSSTALK)  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Hold on, Governor. I've got a question for Governor Bush.  (CROSSTALK)  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	No, we're moving to Governor Bush. Governor, the fact that you're at the fifth lectern tonight shows how far your stock has fallen in this race, despite the big investment your donors have made.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	You noted recently, after slashing your payroll, that you had better things to do than sit around and be demonized by other people. I wanted to ask you --  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	OK.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Got it.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	But it's a -- OK. It's a -- it's a question about why you're having difficulty. I want to ask you in this context.  Ben Bernanke, who was appointed Fed chairman by your brother, recently wrote a book in which he said he no longer considers himself a Republican because the Republican Party has given in to know- nothingism. Is that why you're having a difficult time in this race?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Thank you, Governor.  (CROSSTALK)  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	We're gonna get down the line. Becky's got a question.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Senator Paul, I've got a question for you on the same subject.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Senator Paul?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	You used your time on something else.  Senator Paul?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Senator Paul, the budget deal crafted by Speaker Boehner and passed by the House today makes cuts in entitlement programs, Medicare and Social Security disability, which are the very programs conservatives say need cutting to shrink government and solve our country's long-term budget deficit. Do you oppose that budget deal because it doesn't cut those programs enough?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Senator, if what you just said is true, why did Speaker Boehner craft this deal and why did Paul Ryan, who has a strong reputation for fiscal discipline, vote for it?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Thank you, Senator (inaudible).  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Jim, thanks.  Governor Bush, in a debate like this four years ago, every Republican running for president pledged to oppose a budget deal containing any tax increase even if it had spending cuts ten times as large.  A few months later, you told Congress, put me in, coach, you said you would take that deal. Still feel that way?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	But to -- to the point that you made to Congress, if you were president and you were offered a bipartisan deal that had one dollar...  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	...one dollar of tax increases per ten dollars of spending cuts, would you take it?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	So you don't want the coach to put you in any more?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Thank you, governor.  Carl?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Governor John Kasich, you've called for abolishing the Export Import Bank, which provides subsidies to help American companies compete with overseas competitors. You call that corporate welfare.  One of the largest newspapers in your state wrote an editorial, said they found that strange, writing, that if that's corporate welfare, what does Kasich call the millions of dollars in financial incentives doled out to attract or retain jobs by his development effort -- jobs Ohio.  If subsidies are good enough for Ohio companies, why aren't they good enough for companies trying to compete overseas?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Thank you, Governor.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Thank you, Governor. Thank you.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	"Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate on CNBC, live from Boulder, Colorado at the University of Colorado.  Senator Huckabee, I mean -- excuse me -- Senator Rubio, Wired magazine recently carried the heading, ""Marco Rubio wants to be the tech industry's savior."" It noted your support for dramatically increasing immigration visas called H1B, which are designed for workers with the special skills that Silicon Valley wants.  But your Senate colleague, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, says in reality, the tech industry uses this program to undercut hiring and wages for highly qualified Americans. Why is he wrong?  "	False	True	3
HARWOOD	It sounds like you think Senator Sessions is wrong to believe there is enough abuse in that program that we shouldn't...  (CROSSTALK)  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Thank you, Senator.  Becky?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Governor Bush, the tax reform bill that Ronald Reagan signed in 1986 cut the top personal income tax rate to 28 percent -- just like your plan does. But President Reagan taxed capital gains at the same rate, while you would tax them at just 20 percent.  Given the problems we've been discussing, growing gap between rich and poor, why would you tax labor at a higher rate than income from investments?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Senator Rubio, 30 seconds to you.  The Tax Foundation, which was alluded to earlier, scored your tax plan and concluded that you give nearly twice as much of a gain in after-tax income to the top 1 percent as to people in the middle of the income scale.  Since you're the champion of Americans living paycheck-to- paycheck, don't you have that backward?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	The Tax Foundation -- just to be clear, they said the...  (CROSSTALK)  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	No, I did not.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Senator, the Tax Foundation said after-tax income for the top 1 percent under your plan would go up 27.9 percent.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	And people in the middle of the income spectrum, about 15 percent.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	(inaudible)  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Senator, thank you.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Governor Huckabee, you've written about the huge divide in values between middle America and the big coastal cities like New York and Los Angeles. As a preacher as well as a politician, you know that presidents need the moral authority to bring the entire country together.  The leading Republican candidate, when you look at the average of national polls right now, is Donald Trump. When you look at him, do you see someone with the moral authority to unite the country?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Thank you, Governor.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Thank you, Governor.  Don't forget my colleague, Sharon Epperson.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	What should we do?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	You mean government?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Thank you, Governor.  (APPLAUSE)  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Becky.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Governor Bush, Mr. Trump says that he is capable of growing the economy so much that Social Security and Medicare don't have to be touched. Do you want to explain how that is going to happen, Mr. Trump?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Hold on, Governor. I've got a question for -- for Dr. Carson.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Yes. You've said that you would like to replace Medicare with a system of individual family savings accounts, so that families could cover their own expenses.  Obviously, that would be a very controversial idea. Explain how that would work, exactly.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Governor, do you also think that...  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	...that Dr. Carson's right, that we can replace Medicare with individual savings accounts?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Mrs. Fiorina, we're right at the end of our time.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	You all wanted us to limit (inaudible).  All right. Go ahead.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	We have now reached the point in the program where candidates are going to give their closing statements, 30 seconds apiece. We're going to go right to left and start with you, Senator Paul.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Governor Christie?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Thank you, Governor.  Senator Cruz?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Thank you, Senator.  Mrs. Fiorina?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Mr. Trump?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Just for the record, the debate was always going to be two hours. Senator Rubio?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Senator Rubio.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Thank you, Senator. Governor Bush?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Thank you, Governor. Governor Huckabee.  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Thank you...  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Governor Kasich?  	False	True	3
HARWOOD	Thank you, Governor.  	False	True	3
QUESTION	I'm Mark Watson. I'm known for my [inaudible] views on Youtube, but I'm also a veteran who served in the Army for eight years.  As an African-American living near Ferguson, I've seen the strain between police officers and the communities they serve firsthand. Now, there are great tools like body cameras that — to protect both officers and citizens, but we all currently have better cameras in our pockets than in our precincts. Why aren't we using the technology available to better protect our communities?  	False	True	7
QUESTION	I'm Dulce Candy, a Youtube creator who immigrated to the United States from Mexico when I was a little girl. Since then, I am proud to say I served in the armed forces in Iraq, became a citizen and I am now an entrepreneur.  There are many immigrants who contribute positively to the American economy, but some of the comments in the campaign make us question our place in this country. If America does not seem like a welcoming place for immigrant entrepreneurs, will the American economy suffer?  	False	True	7
QUESTION	I'm Nabela Noor. I'm a Muslim American born and raised in the U.S. who creates beauty and lifestyle videos on Youtube.  In 2015, the number of hate crimes against Muslims in the U.S. has tripled, and on social media, where I spend a lot of time, I've seen many attacks directed towards fellow Muslims. This culture of hatred is only driving ISIS to radicalize, recruit and incite violence.  As president, what would you do to address this toxic climate and promote increased tolerance in the United States?  	False	True	7
CAVUTO	It is 9:00 p.m. here at the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center in South Carolina. Welcome to the sixth Republican presidential of the 2016 campaign, here on the Fox Business Network. I'm Neil Cavuto, alongside my friend and co-moderator Maria Bartiromo.  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Now, the seven candidates on the stage tonight were selected based on their standing in six national polls, as well as polls in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, those standings determining the position on the stage of the candidates tonight. And here they are.  Businessman Donald Trump. [applause]  Texas senator Ted Cruz. [applause]  Florida senator Marco Rubio. [applause]  Neurosurgeon Ben Carson. [applause]  New Jersey governor Chris Christie. [applause]  Former Florida governor Jeb Bush.  And Ohio governor John Kasich. [applause]  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Governor Kasich, we are not even two weeks into this stock trading year, but [inaudible] investors already lost $1.6 trillion in market value. That makes it the worst start to a new year ever. Many worry that things will get even worse, and that banks and financial stocks are particularly vulnerable.  Now, if this escalates, like it did back when Barack Obama first assumed the presidency, what actions would you take if this same thing happens all over again just as, in this example, you are taking over the presidency?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Governor Bush, the president just told the nation two nights ago that America is back and that the idea that our enemies are getting stronger or that this country is getting weaker, well, it's just rhetoric and hot air. Now other Democrats go even further, sir, saying Republicans even suggesting such comments actually embolden our enemies. I guess they would include you. What do you say?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	So I take it from that you do not agree with the president.  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Senator Rubio, the president says that ISIS doesn't threaten our national existence like a Germany or a Japan back in World War II, that the terror group is nothing more than twisted souls plotting attacks in their garages.  But House Homeland Security Committee recently said that over 1,000 ongoing investigations of homegrown extremism in 50 states. So how do you define the threat? Germany then or dangerous nut cases now?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Thank you, Senator.  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Mr. Trump, at the State of the Union, the president pointed to a guest who was a Syrian refugee you might recall whose wife and daughter and other family members were killed in an air attack. Now he fled that country seeking asylum here, ultimately ended up in Detroit where he's now trying to start a new life.  The president says that that doctor is the real face of these refugees and not the one that you and some of your colleagues on this stage are painting; that you prefer the face of fear and terror and that you would refuse to let in anyone into this country seeking legitimate asylum. How do you answer that?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	All right. Welcome back to the Republican presidential , right here in North Charleston, South Carolina. Let's get right back to the questions. And I'll start with you, Senator Cruz.  Now you are, of course, a strict constitutionalist — no one would doubt that. And as you know, the U.S. Constitution says only natural-born citizens are eligible for the office of president of the United States. Stop me if you've heard this before. Now, you were born...[laughter]... you were born in Canada to an American mother. So you were and are considered an American citizen. But that fellow next to you, Donald Trump — and others — have said that being born in Canada means you are not natural-born, and that has raised questions about your eligibility.  Do you want to try to close this topic once and for all tonight?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Mr. Trump...[crosstalk]...that you raised it because of his rising poll numbers.  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Why are you saying this now — right now? Why are you raising this issue now?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Senator, do you want to respond?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	"Marco Rubio. I'm sorry, it's the time constraints. You and Governor Christie have been exchanging some fairly nasty words of late, and I will allow the governor to respond as well.  The governor went so far to say, you won't be able to slime your way to the White House. He's referring to a series of ads done by a PAC, speaking on your behalf, that say quote,""One high tax, Common Core, liberal, energy-loving, Obamacare, Medicaid-expanding president is enough. You think you went too far on that and do you want to apologize to the governor?  "	False	True	6
CAVUTO	That is not my question.  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Is he a liberal?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Is he a liberal?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Governor? [applause]  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	You were?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Well, we are not done. Coming up, one of the top things people are talking about on Facebook, guns. And you can join us live us on this stage in the conversation during this commercial break right from home. You can go to Facebook.com/[inaudible]. We will be streaming live and talking about how we think the is going so far.  We're back in a moment in Charleston, South Carolina.  [commercial break]  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Senator Rubio, you said that President Obama wants to take people's guns away. Yet under his presidency, gun sales have more than doubled. That doesn't sound like a White House unfriendly to gun owners.  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	But what fact can you point to, Senator — what fact can you point to that the president would take away everyone's gun? You don't think that's [inaudible]?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	"Governor Christie, you, too, have criticized the president's recent executive action on gun control, saying it's unconstitutional, another step to bypass Congress. But hasn't your own position on guns evolved, sir? The New Jersey Star-Ledger reports that you signed several laws to regulate the possession of firearms, and that you argued back in August 2013, and I quote, ""These common sense measures will strengthen New Jersey's already tough gun laws.""  So isn't that kind of what the president wants to do now?  "	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Maria...  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Governor bush, for the third time in as many months, the Iranians have provoked us, detaining us, as we've been discussing, with these 10 Navy sailors Tehran had said strayed into their waters. The sailors were released, but only after shown on video apologizing for the incident. This occurring only weeks after Iran fired multiple rockets within 1,500 yards of a U.S. aircraft carrier and then continued to test medium range missiles.  Now you've claimed that such actions indicate Tehran has little to fear from a President Obama. I wonder, sir, what would change if they continued doing this sort of thing under a President Jeb Bush?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Thank you, Governor. Governor Kasich, while everyone has been focusing on Iran's provocations, I'm wondering what you make of what Saudi Arabia has been doing and its recent moves in the region, including its execution of a well-known Shi'ite cleric and its move to dramatically increase oil production, some say in an effort to drive down oil prices and force a lot of U.S. oil producers out of business.  Sure enough, oil prices have tumbled. One brokerage house is predicting a third or more of American oil producers and those heavily invested in fracking will go bankrupt, and soon Saudi Arabia and OPEC will be back in the driver's seat. U.S. energy player Harold Hamrie similarly told me with friends like these, who needs enemies? Do you agree?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Thank you John.  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	But you said — you said that he made those comments and they represented him being unhinged after he made them.  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Well — well, after he made them...[applause]...his poll numbers went up eight points in South Carolina. Now — now, wait...  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Are you — are you saying — are you saying that all those people who agree with Mr. Trump are unhinged?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	"Mr. Trump, sometimes maybe in the heat of the campaign, you say things and you have to dial them back. Last week, the New York Times editorial board quoted as saying that you would oppose, ""up to 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods.""  "	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Well...  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	You never said because they provided that...  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	So they've never said to put a tariff on their...  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	I'm sorry, you lost me.  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Then I apologize. Then I want to understand, if you don't want a 45 percent tariff, say that wasn't the figure, would you be open — are you open to slapping a higher tariff on Chinese goods of any sort to go back at them?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	I know...  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	So you're open to a tariff?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	All right.  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	He is right. If you put a tariff on a good, it's Americans who pay.  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	"Governor Christie, going back to your U.S. Attorney days, you had been praised by both parties as certainly a tough law and order guy. So I wonder what you make of recent statistics that showed violent crimes that have been spiking sometimes by double digit ratings in 30 cities across the country. Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn said, ""most local law enforcement officials feel abandoned by Washington."" Former NYC Police Chief Ray Kelly, says that, ""police are being less proactive because they're being overly scrutinized and second guessed and they're afraid of being sued or thrown in jail.""  What would you do as president to address this?  "	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Thank you governor.  Governor Kasich, as someone has to deal with controversial police shootings in your own state, what do you make of Chicago's move recently to sort of retrain police? Maybe make them not so quick to use their guns?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Thank you, Governor.  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Gentlemen, gentlemen —  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Very quick, very quick.  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Do you think they like each other?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	All right, gentlemen, we've got to stop. I know you are very passionate about that. [applause]  Governor Bush, fears have gripped this country obviously, and you touched on it earlier since the San Bernardino attacks. Since our last , the national conversation has changed, according to Facebook data as well.  Now this first graphic shows the issues that were most talked about right before those attacks and now after: the issues of Islam, homeland security and ISIS now loom very large. The FBI says Islamic radicals are using social media to communicate and that it needs better access to communication. Now the CEO of Apple, Governor, Tim Cook said unless served with a warrant private communication is private, period. Do you agree, or would you try to convince him otherwise?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Would you answer this question?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Fair enough. So Tim Cook — so Tim Cook says he's going to keep it private.  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	But if Tim cook is telling you no, Mr. President.  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Do you ask or do you order?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Governor, thank you. [applause]  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Governor Bush?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Dr. Ben Carson?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Senator Ted Cruz?  	False	True	6
CAVUTO	Gentlemen, thank you all. All of you. That wraps up our debate. We went a little bit over here. But we wanted to make sure everyone was able to say their due. He's upset. All right. Thank you for joining us. Much more to come in the Spin Room ahead.	False	True	6
BLITZER	Welcome to the CNN-Facebook Republican presidential debate here at the Venetian Las Vegas.  We have a very enthusiastic audience. Everyone is here. They're looking forward to a serious and spirited discussion about the security of this nation.  I'm Wolf Blitzer, your moderator tonight. This debate is airing on CNN networks here in the United States and around the world, and on the Salem Radio Network. The nine leading candidates, they are here. Let's welcome them right now.  Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. [applause]  New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. [applause]  Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. [applause]  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. [applause]  Businessman and real estate developer Donald Trump. [applause]  Retired neurosurgeon, Dr. Ben Carson. [applause]  Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. [applause]  Former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. [applause]  And Ohio Governor John Kasich.  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome these Republican candidates for president of the United States. [applause]  This is the final Republican debate before the election year begins, and we're taking a moment for the photographs of the candidates together on the stage. Now, everyone, please rise for the national anthem sung by Ayla Brown.  [national anthem]  [applause]  	False	True	5
BLITZER	I know everyone is eager to get started. So, candidates, please take your places while I explain the ground rules for tonight.  As moderator, I'll guide the discussion, and I'll be joined in the questioning by Salem Radio Network talk show host Hugh Hewitt and CNN's chief political correspondent Dana Bash. We also asked Republicans and independents nationwide to share their questions for the candidates. We teamed up with Facebook to send a campaign camper across the country over the past several weeks.  Thousands of people stepped inside and recorded their questions on video. Millions more have weighed in on Facebook. Candidates, I'll try to make sure each of you gets your fair share of questions. You'll have a minute and 15 seconds to answer and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals. I'll give you time to respond if you're singled out for criticism.  Our viewers should know that we have timing lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when their time is up. And as the candidates requested, a bell will sound like this. We know you are all eager to jump in and debate these important issues, so, please, wait until you're called on.  These nine Republicans are positioned on stage based on their ranking in the recent polls, so let's begin right now. I'd like to invite each candidate to introduce himself or herself to our audience. You'll have one minute.  First to you, Senator Paul.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you, Senator. [applause]  Governor Kasich?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Governor Christie?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Ms. Fiorina?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Governor Bush?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Senator Rubio?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Senator Cruz.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Dr. Carson.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Mr. Trump.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you.  Since you last debated, Americans have witnessed terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. The FBI director says the country now faces the greatest terror threat since 9/11. You all have different approaches to keeping the country safe. And that will be the focus of tonight's debate.  Mr. Trump, as you mentioned in your opening statement, part of your strategy is to focus in on America's borders. To keep the country safe, you say you want to temporarily ban non-American Muslims from coming to the United States; ban refugees fleeing ISIS from coming here; deport 11 million people; and wall off America's southern border. Is the best way to make America great again to isolate it from much of the rest of the world?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	"Governor Bush, you called Mr. Trump ""unhinged"" when he proposed banning non-American Muslims from the United States. Why is that unhinged?  "	False	True	5
BLITZER	Mr. Trump?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Senator Rubio — I'm going to go to Senator Rubio and get his thoughts.  You have said banning Muslims is unconstitutional. But according to a recent ABC News-Washington Post poll, a majority of Republicans support Mr. Trump's idea. Why are they wrong?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Hugh Hewitt, you have a question.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Governor Christie, Americans are clearly more afraid today than at any time since 9/11. As you mentioned in your opening statement, today in Los Angeles, 650 schoolchildren didn't go to — 650,000 schoolchildren didn't go to school because of an e-mail threat, this two weeks after an attack killed 14 people in San Bernardino. Is this the new normal? And if so, what steps would you take as president of the United States to ensure that fear does not paralyze America?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you.  Governor Kasich, one of the killers in San Bernardino was an American who was not on anyone's watch list. How are you going to find that radicalized person and stop another such attack?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you.  Dana Bash, you have the next question.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you.  Dr. Carson, you're in favor of monitoring mosques and schools where there is anti-America sentiment, what do you consider anti- America?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Dr. Carson, who was right in that little debate that we just heard between Senator Rubio and Senator Paul?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	"Hold on a sec, we have a lot more to come and everybody's going to have their full opportunity.  Governor Bush, six days after 9/11 your brother visited a mosque and said quote, ""Islam is peace."" The conversation tonight is about banning Muslims and surveillance of mosques, are President Bush's words still relevant in today's Republican party?  "	False	True	5
BLITZER	Ms. Fiorina, as you pointed out you were a CEO in Silicon Valley on 9/11. Companies there, they say they won't help the FBI now crack encrypted communication from ISIS, should they be forced to.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	But my question was: Should these Silicon Valley companies be forced to cooperate with the FBI?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Mr. Trump, you recently suggested closing that Internet up, those were your words, as a way to stop ISIS from recruiting online. Are you referring to closing down actual portions of the Internet? Some say that would put the U.S. in line with China and North Korea.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Let me follow up, Mr. Trump.  So, are you open to closing parts of the Internet?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you.  Governor Kasich, is shutting down any part of the Internet a good idea?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	"Thank you, Governor.  The fight against radical Islamic terrorists and ISIS has been called the war of our time. So let's talk about how each of you, as commander in chief, would fight this war and win it.  Senator Cruz, you have said you would, quote, ""carpet bomb ISIS into oblivion,"" testing whether, quote, ""sand can glow in the dark."" Does that mean leveling the ISIS capital of Raqqa in Syria where there are hundreds of thousands of civilians?  "	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you. To be clear, Senator Cruz, would you carpet bomb Raqqa, the ISIS capital, where there are a lot of civilians, yes or no?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you. Thank you, Senator.  Senator Rubio, you've been critical of Senator Cruz's strategy. You say his voting record doesn't match his rhetoric. Why?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Because I asked the question, Senator, because you said this. You said he, referring to Senator Cruz, voted against the Defense Authorization Act every year that it came up, and I assume that if he voted against it, he would veto it as president. That's the bill that funds our troops.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Senator Cruz?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Senator Rubio.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	We are going to have much more on this...  	False	True	5
BLITZER	We're going to have much more on this. But I want to move now back to Mr. Trump.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	We have a lot...  	False	True	5
BLITZER	We have a lot to discuss. I want to move to Mr. Trump right now. We have a question on this war against ISIS and how you would fight and win this war. Here's the question from Facebook. Listen to this.  [start video]  JOSH JACOB, COLLEGE STUDENT: I'm Josh Jacob from Georgia Tech. Recently Donald Trump mentioned we must kill the families of ISIS members. However, this violates the principle of distinction between civilians and combatants in international law.  So my question is, how would intentionally killing innocent civilians set us apart from ISIS?  [end video]  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Mr. Trump.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Governor Bush. Governor Bush.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Mr. Trump.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Just one at a time, go ahead...  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Go ahead, Mr. Trump.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Governor Bush, please.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	One at a time.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Governor Bush.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	All right. Hugh Hewitt and Dana Bash, Hugh, go ahead with the next question.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you, Governor.  Senator Rubio? Let's continue this conversation. This is a critically important issue.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	We will get to — we have a lot of time, Ms. Fiorina.  I want to get to Senator Rubio right now. Let's talk about, one of the aspects of your strategy, you say the only way to defeat ISIS is with ground forces made up primarily of Sunni-Arab forces. Those Arab nations, though, as you well know, they've conducted less than five percent of the airstrikes and actually none since August. What makes you think they are willing to fight on the ground if they're not even willing to fight from the air?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	"Thank you, Senator. Stand by. [applause]  Ms. Fiorina, the former defense secretary, Bob Gates, says the chances of getting Sunni-Arab forces on the ground to get the job done, his words, ""chances very remote."" What's your strategy?  "	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you.  Governor Christie, what's your strategy?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Dr. Carson, what is your strategy?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you.  Everyone stand by. We're only just beginning. Coming up, which candidates on this stage tonight want to move foreign policy in a dramatically new direction?  We'll be right back.  [commercial break]  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Welcome back to the CNN-Facebook Republican Presidential Debate here at the Venetian, Las Vegas.  The war against ISIS will pose many new challenges for the next commander-in-chief. The last two presidents pursued a Middle East policy that supported toppling dictators to try to promote democracy.  Senator Cruz, you have said the world would be safer today if Saddam Hussein were still in power in Iraq, Moammar Gadhafi ruled Libya, and Hosni Mubarak ruled Egypt. So would it be your policy to preserve dictatorships, rather than promoting democracy in the Middle East?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator. [applause]  Senator Rubio, you supported the removal of Moammar Gadhafi in Libya. Now that country is in turmoil, as ISIS is clearly growing there. Senator Cruz says you haven't learned your lesson. Do you have any regrets for supporting President Obama's intervention in Libya?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Senator Cruz?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Standby. Everybody standby for a moment. Governor Kasich, go ahead.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	We're going to talk about Assad in a moment.  Mr. Trump, are Americans safer with dictators running the world in the Middle East?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you.  Mr. Trump?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	All right.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Dr. Carson, is the Middle East...  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Dr. Carson, is the Middle East better off with dictators?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Governor Bush.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	"Hold on Governor Bush., here's the question. You said, ""getting rid of Saddam Hussein in your words was a pretty good deal."" In light of what has happened in Iraq, do you still feel that way?  "	False	True	5
BLITZER	Senator Paul, was getting rid of Saddam Hussein a pretty good deal?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you. [crosstalk]  Hugh Hewitt, go ahead. [crosstalk]  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hugh.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Senator, Senator, we're going to get to you. Wait your turn. We have two hours of debate. We'll have plenty of time. Let Hugh ask his question.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Senator, please.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Senator...  	False	True	5
BLITZER	You'll have plenty of opportunity.  Hugh, go ahead.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	These are the rules all of you agreed to.  Hugh, go ahead with your question.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Let's continue with Russia right now. We have another question from Facebook. Listen and watch.  [start video]  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Ms. Fiorina, as you know, U.S. and Russian warplanes are flying all over Syria right now. With so many lives on the line, is this a good time for the United States not to talk to Putin?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.  Governor Christie, if the U.S. imposed a no-fly zone over Syria and a Russian plane encroached, invaded that no-fly zone, would you be prepared to shoot down that Russian plane and risk war with Russia?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Senator Paul — Senator Paul, I want you to respond to what we just heard from Governor Christie. If there was a no-fly zone, you say that potentially could lead to World War III. Why?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Governor Christie?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	All right, let's go back — Hugh and Dana?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	One at a time. Hugh, go ahead.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	"Governor, thank you very much.  So, Dr. Carson, you recently visited a refugee camp in Jordan and you deemed it your words, ""really quite nice."" Saying the people there didn't want to come to the United States. Do you think these camps are a long-term solution of the problem of Syrian refugees?  "	False	True	5
BLITZER	Senator Paul, you oppose letting in Syrian refugees at this time into the United States. The U.S. has already accepted 2,000 Syrian refugees, including 13 living here in Las Vegas right now. Would you send them back? What would you do with these people?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Senator Rubio? [applause]  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Senator Paul, you didn't answer the question about the 2,000 Syrian refugees who are already here in the United States. Will you send them back or let them stay?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	We have another — we have another question. We have another question from Facebook. Let's listen.  [start video]  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Governor Christie, you say there should be a pause in allowing new refugees to come into the United States, including orphans under the age of five. What do you say to Carla?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Governor Kasich.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you, Governor.  There is much more coming up. We are only just beginning. Coming up, what other global hot spots await the next president of the United States. [applause]  [commercial break]  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Welcome back to the CNN-Facebook Republican Presidential Debate. We're here at the Venetian Las Vegas. Tonight we have been focusing on the Middle East, but let's turn to some other world threats that you will potentially face as Commander in Chief.  Ms. Fiorina, candidates here have called the North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un a maniac who is mentally unstable. Last week he said he now has a hydrogen bomb. If you were elected president, what would you do about Kim Jong-Un?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Dr. Carson, what would you do about Kim Jong-Un?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you, Dr. Carson. Dana and Hugh you have questions as well.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you, Senator Rubio.  Some of you on this stage have questioned whether your opponents have temperament, the right temperament, to be in control of the nuclear codes.  Dana, you have a question on this?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you, senator. Thank you.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.  We're a month and a half away now from the first real test who will be the Republican presidential nominee.  Hugh, you have a question?  	False	True	5
BLITZER	All right. Candidates, we have more coming up. When we come back, everyone will have an opportunity to explain why this particular candidate, each of you on the stage, believes he or she should be the Republican presidential nominee. [applause]  [commercial break]  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Now it's time for the closing statements from the candidates. Each one has 30 seconds.  Senator Paul.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Governor Kasich.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Governor Christie.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Ms. Fiorina.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Governor Bush.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Senator Rubio.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Senator Cruz.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Dr. Carson.  	False	True	5
BLITZER	Thanks to all the Republican presidential candidates. That does it for this Republican presidential debate.	False	True	5
MODERATOR	Coming up more of our debate, including questions about President Obama's foreign policy and these guys and their better ideas. Coming up.  [commercial break]  	False	True	1
FIORINA	"Like all of you I'm angry. I'm angry at what's happening to our nation. Citizens, it's time to take our country back.  Bombastic insults wont take it back. Political rhetoric that promises a lot and delivers little, won't take it back. All of our problems can be solved. All of our wounds can be healed by a tested leader who is willing to fight for the character of our nation.  I have been tested. I have beaten breast cancer. I have buried a child. I started as a secretary. I fought my way to the top of corporate America while being called every B word in the book. I fought my way into this election and on to this debate stage while all the political insiders and the pundits told, ""it couldn't be done.""  I've been told, ""no,: all my life. And all my life, I've refused to accept no as an answer. Citizens, it is time to take our country back from the political class, from the media, from the liberal elite. It can be done, it must be done, join me and we will get it done. [applause]  "	False	True	5
FIORINA	What I think we need to stand for are solutions. I offer myself as a leader to the people of this country because I think they're looking for solutions, not lawyers arguing over laws or entertainers throwing out sound bites that draw media attention. We need to solve the problem.  To solve the problem, we need to do something here at home and something over there in their caliphate. We need to deny them territory.  But here at home, we need to do two fundamental things. Number one, we need to recognize that technology has moved on. The Patriot Act was signed in 2001, roughly. The iPhone was invented in 2007. The iPad was invented in 2011. Snapchat and Twitter, all the rest of it, have been around just for several years. Technology has moved on, and the terrorists have moved on with it.  Let me tell you a story. Soon after 9/11, I got a phone call from the NSA. They needed help. I gave them help. I stopped a truckload of equipment. I had it turned around. It was escorted by the NSA into headquarters. We need the private sector's help, because government is not innovating. Technology is running ahead by leaps and bound. The private sector will help, just as I helped after 9/11. But they must be engaged, and they must be asked. I will ask them. I know them. [applause]  	False	True	5
FIORINA	"You know, listening to this conversation, let me just say, we have a lot of argument about laws but none of it solves the problem. Let's examine what happened, why did we miss the Tsarnaev brothers, why did we miss the San Bernardino couple? It wasn't because we had stopped collected metadata it was because, I think, as someone who comes from the technology world, we were using the wrong algorithms.  This is a place where the private sector could be helpful because the government is woefully behind the technology curve. But secondly, the bureaucratic processes that have been in place since 9/11 are woefully inadequate as well. What do we now know? That DHS vets people by going into databases of known or suspected terrorists.  And yet, we also know that ISIS is recruiting who are not in those databases. So of course, we're going to miss them. And then we now learn that DHS says, ""No, we can't check their social media.""  For heaven's sakes, every parent in America is checking social media and every employer is as well, but our government can't do it. The bureaucratic procedures are so far behind. Our government has become incompetent, unresponsive, corrupt. And that incompetence, ineptitude, lack of accountability is now dangerous.  It is why we need a different kind of leadership in the White House that understands how to get bureaucracies competent again.  "	False	True	5
FIORINA	They do not need to be forced. They need to be asked to bring the best and brightest, the most recent technology to the table. I was asked as a CEO. I complied happily. And they will as well. But they have not been asked. That's why it cost billions of dollars to build an Obama website that failed because the private sector wasn't asked. [applause]  	False	True	5
FIORINA	I hope at some point you're going to ask me my strategy.  	False	True	5
FIORINA	"Well, first I'll just point out that talking tough is not the same as being strong. And to wage war, we need a commander in chief who has made tough calls in tough times and stood up to be held accountable over and over, not first-term senators who've never made an executive decision in their life.  One of the things I would immediately do, in addition to defeating them here at home, is bring back the warrior class — Petraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, Flynn. Every single one of these generals I know. Every one was retired early because they told President Obama things that he didn't want to hear.  We must have Sunni-Arabs involved in this coalition. We must commit leadership, strength, support and resolve. I'll just add that Margaret Thatcher once said, ""If you want something talked about, ask a man; if you want something done, ask a woman."" [applause]  "	False	True	5
FIORINA	"That is exactly what President Obama said. I'm amazed to hear that from a republican presidential candidate. But let's just start with, who got it wrong? Who really got it wrong?  Hillary Clinton has gotten every foreign policy challenge wrong. Hitting the reset button with Vladimir Putin – recall that she called Bashar Al-Assad a positive reformer and then she opened an embassy and then later she said, over, and over, and over again, ""Bashar Al-Assad must go."" Although she wasn't prepared to do anything about it. Recall that Hillary Clinton was all for toppling Gadhafi then didn't listen to her own people on the ground. And then of course, when she lied about the terrorist attack in Benghazi, she invited more terrorist attacks.  "	False	True	5
FIORINA	We've mismanaged going into Iraq.  	False	True	5
FIORINA	We've mismanaged going out of Iraq.  	False	True	5
FIORINA	We actually...  	False	True	5
FIORINA	I didn't say I would cut off all communication with Putin. What I said was as president of the United States, now is not the time to talk with him. Reagan walked away at Reykjavik. There is a time and a place for everything. There is a time and a place for talk. And there is a time and a place for action.  I know Vladimir Putin. He respects strength. He lied to our president's face; didn't both to tell him about warplanes and troops going into Syria. We need to speak to him from a position of strength. So as commander in chief, I will not speak to him until we've set up that no-fly zone; until we've gathered our Sunni-Arab allies and begun to deny ISIS territory; until I've called the supreme leader of Iran and told him new deal — new deal. We the United States of America are going to cut off the money flow, which we can do; which we don't need anyone's permission or collaboration to do.  And I will not speak to him personally until we've rebuilt the 6th Fleet a little bit right under his nose; rebuilt the missile defense program in Poland right under his nose; and conducted a few military exercises in the Baltic states.  And let us remember one other thing. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are responsible for the growth of ISIS because they precipitously withdrew from Iraq in 2011 against the advice of every single general and for political expediency. It's not these people up here. It's Hillary Clinton. [applause]  	False	True	5
FIORINA	This doesn't do a thing to solve the problems...It doesn't do a thing to solve the problems.  [crosstalk]  	False	True	5
FIORINA	It will not solve the problem.  	False	True	5
FIORINA	Ladies and gentleman, this is why the American people are standing up.  	False	True	5
FIORINA	This is why the nation is fed up...  	False	True	5
FIORINA	We have been talking about this...  	False	True	5
FIORINA	Sorry, but you haven't gotten to me. This is why...  	False	True	5
FIORINA	the people are fed up with the political class.  	False	True	5
FIORINA	Well, first, Kim Jong-Un is a dangerous leader, without a doubt. And both Republican and Democrat administrations have been completely ineffective in dealing with him. So we must continue to isolate him. We will need China as part of that strategy.  China is a rising adversary. So one of the things we have to do if we want China's support is to push back on China. They, too, recognize one thing — strength and their own economic interest.  I have done business in China for 25 years, so I know that in order to get China to cooperate with us, we must first actually retaliate against their cyber-attacks so they know we're serious. We have to push back on their desire to control the trade route through the South China Sea through which flows $5 trillion worth of goods and services every year.  We cannot let them control the disputed islands, and we must work with the Australians, the South Koreans, the Japanese and the Filipinos to contain China. And then we must ask for their support and their help with North Korea. Because believe it or not, China is as concerned about Kim Jong-Un as we are.  	False	True	5
FIORINA	I too remember September 11th. I remember immediately putting into place security procedures all throughout our company that did business in 170 countries where we thought corporate interests would be attacked next. To take our country back, to keep our nation safe, we have to begin by beating Hillary Clinton.  We need to unify our party. We need to better than our government, which 75 percent of the American people now think is corrupt and incompetent. They're right. We need to better than our politics. 80 percent think we have a professional/political class of both parties that cares more about its power, position and privilege than actually on getting anything done.  We need to unify our party, we need a real Conservative in the White House, and we need to beat Hillary Clinton to take our country back and keep our nation safe.  I can. I am. And together, if you join me, we will take our country back.  	False	True	5
BUSH	Chris, why don't you mention my name so I can get into this.  	False	True	8
BUSH	... I appreciate that, I really do, thank you.  	False	True	8
BUSH	Well, first of all he said the exact same thing about me, that I would make a great Vice Presidential nominee when Mitt Romney was considering. I said the same thing about Marco. I think we were both right at the time, and Mitt picked somebody else. So, let's move on to the 2016 race. Who has the leadership skills... [applause]...who has the leadership skills to lead? And, I'm proud of the fact that I have 12 Medal of Honor recipients, over 30 admirals and generals that believe that I would be a steady hand as Commander in Chief. That I serve as Governor of the state of Florida where we cut taxes and reduced government. I took on very powerful interests, forged consensus, fought for my beliefs, implemented them and the state was better off.  We had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months. The whole state was turned upside down. It required a steady hand. Leadership. You learn this, you learn it by doing it. It's not something that you just go up, and on the job do it. [applause]  It's not the same. Look, let's be clear. Marco Rubio is a gifted, gifted politician, and he may have the skills to be a President of the United States, but we've tried it the old way with Barack Obama, with soaring eloquence and we got — we didn't get a leader we got someone who wants to divide the country up. The next President...[bell rings]...going to have to forge consensus to bring about a set of common purposes so that we can move forward again in this country...  	False	True	8
BUSH	... this relates to strategic patience. [applause]  	False	True	8
BUSH	This relates to the strategic patience of the Obama administration. They come up with these great marketing terms, and what they do is they pull back, and voids are filled, and they're now filled by asymmetric threats of terror, as well as nation-states on the run.  The next president of the United States is gonna have to get the United States back in the game, and if a preemptive strike is necessary to keep us safe, then we should do it. [applause]  	False	True	8
BUSH	Well, first of all, it's interesting that that happened literally days when this hostage release took place in Iran. A day or two days afterwards, North Korea took a — held an American student hostage. I think it's when we send a signal of weakness, when we are negotiating to release people that committed crimes in our country for people that didn't commit crimes that are held hostage in Iran.  We saw the shameful treatment of our sailors, that this creates weakness — sends a signal of weakness around the world. The next president of the United States is going to have to get back in the game. Where the United States' word matters. Where we back up our allies, where we don't send signals of weakness. We need to use every — every influence possible to get this student back.  And I think John is right about this, there are crippling sanctions that are available, as it relates to the two or three banks that North Korea uses to — to — use it — illicit trade. We ought to re-establish sanctions, not just because of the student, but because of their actions that they're taking right now, as it relates to building this missile capability.  	False	True	8
BUSH	Good evening.  	False	True	8
BUSH	The difference — the difference between eminent domain for public purpose — as Donald said, roads and infrastructure, pipelines and all that — that's for public purpose. But what Donald Trump did was use eminent domain to try to take the property of an elderly woman on the strip in Atlantic City. That is not public purpose, that is down right wrong. [applause]  And here's the problem with that. The problem was, it was to tear down — it was to tear down — it was to tear down the house...  	False	True	8
BUSH	And the net result was — you tried.  	False	True	8
BUSH	And you lost in the court.  	False	True	8
BUSH	That is not true. And the simple fact is to turn this into a limousine parking lot for his casinos is a not public use. [applause]  And in Florida, based on what we did, we made that impossible. It is part of our Constitution. That's the better approach. That is the conservative approach.  	False	True	8
BUSH	How tough it is to take away property from an elderly woman?  	False	True	8
BUSH	How tough it is to take away a property from an elderly woman?  	False	True	8
BUSH	I consider it a public use.  	False	True	8
BUSH	It's a public use. It's a public use.  	False	True	8
BUSH	It's a public use.  	False	True	8
BUSH	Yeah.  	False	True	8
BUSH	It's a public use.  	False	True	8
BUSH	Established by the courts — federal, state courts.  	False	True	8
BUSH	I would like to see more millionaires. I think we need to grow more millionaires, we need create a prosperity society where people can rise up. [applause]  This notion that somehow we're undertaxed as a nation is just fool hearty, when we have entitlements growing far faster than our ability to pay for it. A conservative, because that's the point of this, believes in limited government, believes in a entrepreneurial capitalism and a strong national defense.  But it also has to be, we need to reform things. In my town hall meetings, I went to a place where a woman described her neighbor, who has a better economic deal by not working than her struggling to make ends meet. We need to be on the side of working people. And you know, the problem with the left is, another tax, another regulation, another mandate makes it harder for them to rise up.  Everything that we should do should be focused on high, sustained economic growth, where the middle class gets a raise for the first time, and where people are rewarded for work, rather than non-work. And I know how to do this. And if people are interested in the specifics of this, they ought to go to jeb2016.com. [applause]  	False	True	8
BUSH	Martha — Martha, if I...  	False	True	8
BUSH	I would. And I would do it in concert, again, with our Arab allies and with Europe, most particularly in this case. This is the lesson learned: in history, if you bomb something and not do anything as it relates to deal with the aftermath of this, if you don't have a stable government, you get what we have in Libya.  And this is not — leading from behind is not an effective policy. We have to lead. Without the United States, nothing seems to work. Europe doesn't have the ability to — to — to lead — forward lead in this regard.  And so dealing with the caliphate is important, because it now has spawned other areas. There have been 70-plus attacks in 17 countries, either inspired by ISIS or organized by ISIS, Libya being the most important one now.  We have to deal with the caliphate, with building a Sunni army there, but we also have to deal with it in Libya. And I think the United States, ultimately, is going to play — play a significant role in this.  The problem with the Obama administration is that they see this incrementally. They're reluctant. They don't lead. No one knows whether we're serious, and when we do it, we do it in increments you can barely see. [bell rings]  The United States has to lead in a much more aggressive way than we're doing right now. [applause]  	False	True	8
BUSH	Martha and David, I just...  	False	True	8
BUSH	Martha and David...  	False	True	8
BUSH	No, no, I wouldn't. No, I wouldn't. And it was used sparingly, Congress has changed the laws and I — and I think where we stand is the appropriate place. But what we need to do is to make sure that we expand our intelligence capabilities.  The idea that we're going to solve this fight with predator drones, killing people somehow is a — is more acceptable than capturing them, securing the information. This is why closing Guantanamo is a complete disaster. What we need to do is make sure that we are kept safe...[applause]...by having intelligence capabilities, both human and technological intelligence capabilities far superior than what we have today. That's how you get a more safe place is by making sure that we're fully engaged. And right now, this administration doesn't do that.  	False	True	8
BUSH	This is a — this is an important subject. I agree with everything that's been said here about repealing unconstitutional rules and rules that are creating real burdens for investing that creating jobs.  But we also ought to get back to being a Tenth Amendment country, as well, a country that respects the states to be able to make more decisions. And in the Bush administration, we would shift transportation dollars back to the states. I trust Kasich and Christie to build the roads and the infrastructure of their states than Washington, D.C.  EPA delegated authority, back to the states. Education dollars, back to the states. I would like to see reform take place all across the country, where there's more vouchers, more freedom. [applause]  If we did that, we would shrink government's power in Washington, D.C. and we would have a much more effective government, where people would begin to trust our government again, because now, no one believes it works.  	False	True	8
BUSH	You mentioned me. He mentioned me. One other thing that I think we ought to do, along with repealing Obamacare, we need to shift all of this power of healthcare, which is the most egregious form of federal power that is suppressing wages and incomes, and allow governors to have the Medicaid plans so that they can create 21st century Medicaid insurance for people that are stuck in poverty. There's so much that can be done, but I don't trust Washington to do it. I trust the state capitals to be the place — to be the source of innovation and reform in this country. [applause]  	False	True	8
BUSH	I didn't mention him the second time.  	False	True	8
BUSH	... Say it again?  	False	True	8
BUSH	... I do, and I do think that we should not impose any kind of political agenda on the military. There should be — if women can meet the requirements, the minimum requirements for combat service they ought to have the right to do it. For sure. It ought to be focused on the morale as well. We got to make sure that we have readiness much higher than we do today. We need to eliminate the sequester which is devastating our military.  We can't be focusing on the political side of this, we need to realize that our military force is how we project our word in the world. When we're weak militarily it doesn't matter what we say. We can talk about red lines, and ISIS being the J.V. team, and reset buttons and all this. If we don't have a strong military than no one fears us, and they take actions that are against our national interest.  	False	True	8
BUSH	... Why would they worry about it...  	False	True	8
BUSH	... Well, the Draft's not going to be reinstituted, but why — if women are accessing...  	False	True	8
BUSH	No. I didn't say that. You — you asked a question not about the draft, you asked about registering. And if women are going to be...  	False	True	8
BUSH	If — but...  	False	True	8
BUSH	... we don't have a draft. I'm not suggesting we have a draft. What I'm suggesting is that we ought to have readiness being the first priority of our military, and secondly, that we make sure that the morale is high. And right now, neither one of those are acceptable because we've been gutting the military budget.  We also need to reform our procurement process. We need to make sure there are more men and women in uniform than people — than civilians in our Defense Department. There's a lot of things that we need to reform to bring our defense capabilities into the 21st century and I'm the guy that could do that. That's why I have the support of generals, of admirals, of 12 Medal of Honor recipients and many other people that know that I would be a steady commander-in-chief and rebuild our military. [applause]  	False	True	8
BUSH	I totally agree that we need to give veterans more choices. A veterans card to be able to go to a private provider will enhance the quality of the service inside the Department of Veterans Affairs. We need career civil service reform. Only three people were fired after waiting lists were dropped where veterans didn't get care and people died. It is outrageous. And Hillary Clinton says that that's acceptable? Because she is captive of the public service uniforms.  Career civil service reform would allow the next president to fire people that are — that are showing sheer incompetence. At a town hall meeting today, someone came — told a story of their father who looked like he was 85. He had — he got a bill eight years later from an operation he had, eight years it took. They couldn't resolve the dispute and then he was told that he died. Literally, the Veterans Administration sent a death certificate to this guy and it took nine months to clarify the guy — I met him. He's voting for me. And he is — likely to be alive. [laughter] [applause]  This is — this is outrageous. It is completely outrageous. So, giving veterans more choices, creating centers of excellence, focusing on the true problems that exist. Dr. Carson is completely right. We need to start focusing on this earlier, before they become veterans so that there's a customized plan so people don't fall through the cracks. We can do this, but it's going to require someone who has proven leadership skills to make it happen. [applause]  	False	True	8
BUSH	Look, I'm pro-life. In fact, on this stage, I'm the most pro-life person because I've acted on it for eight years as governor of the state of Florida. [applause]  Where we abolished partial-birth abortion, where parents have the right to be notified when their teenage child is having an abortion. We were the first state to do a choose life license plate to raise money for adoption. We were the first state to have state monies go to crisis pregnancy centers, which recently was just increased to $4 million a year.  We created greater regulation on abortion clinics, where there were horrific procedures. So I'm pro life, but I believe there should be exceptions: rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in danger. And so, that belief, and my consistency on this, makes me, I think, poised to be in the right place, the sweet spot for a Republican nominee. And others may have a different view and I respect it. [applause] BUSH: But I think we have to be cognizant of the fact there's a lot of people that are concerned about having a pro-life position without any exceptions. [applause]  	False	True	8
BUSH	Peyton Manning is supporting me. And I'm for Denver. [laughter]  	False	True	8
BUSH	I want to thank the people of New Hampshire, and I want to celebrate the birthday of a great president, Ronald Reagan would have been 105 today. [applause]  President Reagan believed in the future of our country, believed in its greatness, had a hopeful, optimistic message. Drew people towards our cause. We need someone who has a proven record to take our case to the American people because our philosophy is by far the best one. Limited government, entrepreneurial capitalism, of peace through strength. I believe I have the skills to take our party to victory in November.  I ask for your support on Tuesday to keep America, and make America a safer, stronger, and freer. Thank you all very much. [applause]  	False	True	8
MCELVEEN	"Thank you, David. And good evening, candidates. Mr. Trump, you have said, quote, ""I love eminent domain"" which is the seizure of private property for the sake of the greater good theoretically. You tried to use the measure in business endeavors, you've said you'd support its use for the Keystone Pipeline project.  Here in New Hampshire, a project, though, known as the Northern pass would bring hydro-electric power from Canada into the Northeastern grid. Do you see eminent domain as an appropriate tool to get that done?  "	False	True	8
MCELVEEN	So would that be yes on the Northern Pass project? [applause]  	False	True	8
MCELVEEN	Mr. Trump, take 30 seconds.  	False	True	8
MCELVEEN	All right, gentlemen...  	False	True	8
MCELVEEN	Gentlemen, we do have to move forward. Dave, Martha, back to you.  	False	True	8
MCELVEEN	You're all aware, candidates, this is a major problem here in New Hampshire. It's a very deadly problem as well. Last month, New Hampshire senators Kelly Ayotte, Republican, and Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat, they went down to Washington, along with the police chief of the state's largest city to testify before the Judiciary Committee in D.C.  Senator Cruz, you're a member of that committee. Your campaign schedule didn't allow you to attend this. Even so, the police chief called your absence outrageous, given the severity of the problem. Last week, though, you told a personal story of a close family member's struggle with addiction. What can you say to law enforcement right now to convince them that you understand the severity of this problem and you're not just saying what people want to hear days before the primary?  	False	True	8
MCELVEEN	And Governor Christie, you have talked a lot about this issue here in New Hampshire. [applause]  State reforms, criminal justice reforms, access to treatment.  To Senator Cruz's point, let's take it a step further. Would you be willing to engage in cross-border enforcement into Mexico, a place where law enforcement in New Hampshire has traced at lot of this supply back to. Would you engage in cross-border enforcement without the cooperation without the Mexican government?  	False	True	8
MCELVEEN	Governor Christie, thank you very much.  David, Martha, back to you.  	False	True	8
MCELVEEN	Thank you, Martha. None of you on stage tonight have ever worn a uniform as a member of the armed services. That's the reality of it. But as commander-in-chief, you'll also be charged with the care of 23 million active duty service members and veterans in this country.  Some have suggested privatizing the V.A. as a way to enhance care and increase the quality of the care and access. Others say that veterans should carry I.D. cards that allow them access to any hospital or health care provider. Governor Bush, what specifically would you do to ensure that those who have sacrificed for us are cared for?  	False	True	8
MCELVEEN	Governor Kasich, do you have a favored approach?  	False	True	8
MCELVEEN	Senator Rubio, go ahead?  	False	True	8
MCELVEEN	Senator Rubio, thanks very much. Going to move forward now. David, Martha, back to you.  	False	True	8
WALKER	Good evening, I'm Scott Walker, and tonight, I want to thank and Mrs. Reagan, and the Reagan Library for hosting us. You see, in my lifetime, the greatest president was a governor from California. Ronald Reagan knew how to go big, and go bold. He understood the essence of moving this country forward, and that's what I did when I took on the status quo in my state, and the Washington based special interest.  Now, more than ever, America needs a leader who will go big and bold again. Someone who's been tested. I'm ready to be that leader. Thank you. [applause]  	False	True	2
WALKER	But Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake...  	False	True	2
WALKER	But Jake, this — this is — this...  	False	True	2
WALKER	Jake, this is — this is — this is...  	False	True	2
WALKER	This is actually what's wrong — this is what's wrong with this debate. We're not talking about real issues.  And Mr. Trump, we don't need an apprentice in the White House. [applause]  We don't need an apprentice in the White House. We have one right now. He told us all the things we wanted to hear back in 2008. We don't know who you are or where you're going. We need someone who can actually get the job done.  And you talked about business.  	False	True	2
WALKER	You — you — let me finish...  	False	True	2
WALKER	No, no...  	False	True	2
WALKER	You're using the talking...  	False	True	2
WALKER	Mr. Trump, you're using the talking points of the Democrats...  	False	True	2
WALKER	... and as we all know...  	False	True	2
WALKER	... that failed three times in four and a half years when I got elected, because it is working. We balanced a budget.  You want to talk about balanced budgets? You took four major projects into bankruptcy over and over and over again. You can't take America into bankruptcy. That's what's wrong with the politicians in Washington right now. They think we can take a country into bankruptcy.  [crosstalk]  	False	True	2
WALKER	Jake, yeah, absolutely, I'll take this on, because this is an issue that's important in this race.  Just because he says it doesn't make it true. The facts are the facts. [applause]  We balanced a $3.6 billion budget deficit, we did it by cutting taxes — $4.7 billion to help working families, family farmers, small business owners and senior citizens. And it's about time people in America stand up and take note of this.  If you want someone that can actually take on the special interest of Washington, which you yourself said you were part of, using the system, we need somebody that will stand up and fight for average Americans to put them back in charge of their government.  I'm the one who is taking that on. I'll do that as your next president.  	False	True	2
WALKER	Two parts to that, one on China, one back for a second on Iran.  When it comes to China, why would we be giving an official state visit to a country that's been involved in a massive cyber attack against the United States? That's not just a visit, that's a 21 gun salute on the South Lawn of the White House. It just doesn't make any sense. If we're ever going to send a message to them, wouldn't this be the time, when they've issued this, sort of, massive attack against us?  And, Jake, for the question, I was one of the first ones to call for terminating the bad deal with Iran on day one. The President came after me and said I need to bone up. You know, the President who called ISIS the JV squad said I needed to bone up.  The reality is it's a bad deal on day one, and it's a bad deal because this president has allowed Iran to go closer, and closer.  I'd love to play cards with this guy because Barack Obama folds on everything with Iran. We need a leader who's going to stand up, and actually [inaudible]...  	False	True	2
WALKER	Jake, just one more moment. This is — there's something bigger to this. Now, I — like so many other governors here, I defunded Planned Parenthood four-and-a-half years ago, in a Blue State. But it's bigger than that. We did that in a Blue State, we took the money and put it into women's health, so we did exactly what we're talking about here.  But I think the bigger issue here is we should be able to do this nationally, and this is precisely why so many Republicans are upset with Washington. They see the House and they see the Senate and they say why can't we pass this. Why can't we defund Planned — put it in a spending bill.  Forget about the 60-vote rule, there's no reason — and the Constitution doesn't call for 60 votes. Pass it with 51 votes, put it on the desk of the president —  	False	True	2
WALKER	— and go forward and actually make a point. This is why —  	False	True	2
WALKER	— people are upset with Washington.  	False	True	2
WALKER	So, the best way to help people see their wages go up is to get them the education, the skill they need, to take on careers that pay more than minimum wage. And, it's why we talk about it, it's all about jobs. You want to help actually get jobs, it's why on that last question we were trying to jump in on taxes. To me, it's not just about taxes, cutting taxes. I've done it as much as anyone has.  I've cut income taxes, I've cut property taxes. In fact, property taxes are lower today in my state than they were before we took office. The real issues about jobs.  Ronald Reagan, our plan is based on the Ronald Reagan tax cuts of 1986. That brought about one of the longest sustained periods of economic growth in American history. All the things we should be talking about tonight are about how do we create jobs, helping people get the skills and the education qualifications they need to succeed.  That's the way you help people create jobs. It's part of our large plan to reform the tax code, to cut taxes, to put in place an education system that gives people the skills and education that they need. To put in place all the above energy policy, but you start on day one with repealing Obamacare.  I'm the only one on this stage that's actually got a plan, introduced an actual plan to repeal Obamacare on day one. I'll send a bill up to Congress, and to make sure enact it...  	False	True	2
WALKER	...I'm going to sign an order that makes the Congress live by the same rules as everybody else.  	False	True	2
WALKER	...That will ensure they repeal Obamacare...  	False	True	2
WALKER	...Jake, Jake, Jake, I just want to address that issue because you said I didn't answer, and I did. I said, to me, I think the real focus shouldn't be — you know, Hillary Clinton talks about the minimum wage. That's her answer to grow the economy. The answer is to give people the skills and the education so they make far more than minimum wage.  I don't want to argue about how low things are going to be, I want to talk about how do we lift everyone up in America. That's what Reagan talked about. It wasn't how bad things were, it was how to make it better for everyone. That's what we've done in Wisconsin, that's exactly what we'd do as...  	False	True	2
WALKER	: That's because of Barack — that's because of Barack Obama.  	False	True	2
WALKER	: That's because of Barack Obama. We've had a president who called ISIS the J.V. squad, Yemen a success story, Iran a place we can do business with. It's not because of George W. Bush; it's because of Barack Obama... [applause] [inaudible] on that point, though, whether it's — whether we're talking about national security, foreign policy or we're talking about domestic policy, the key...  	False	True	2
WALKER	... the key issue here is talking about leadership. Now, there's a lot of greater people up here, and you've heard a lot of great ideas out there. But I would ask the American people, look at who's been tested.  When there were 100,000 protesters in my capital, I didn't back down, when they issued death threats against me and threats against my family, I didn't back down, when they tried to recall me, I didn't back down, and when they made me the — one of their number-one targets last year, I didn't back down.  Give me the chance to be your president.  	False	True	2
WALKER	I won't back down...  	False	True	2
WALKER	... on any of these issues.  	False	True	2
WALKER	To be clear, what I said the other day was that we need to lift the political restrictions that are already in play. Barack Obama's administration has put political restrictions on the military personnel already in Iraq.  We need to lift those and then we need to listen to our military experts, not the political forces in the White House, but our military experts about how many more we sent in. And we certainly shouldn't have a commander-in-chief who sends a message to our adversaries as to how far we're going to go, and how far we're willing to fight, so I'm not putting a troop number.  What I'm saying is lift the political restrictions. When you do that, you empower our military personnel already there to work with the Kurd and the Sunni allies, to reclaim the territory taken by ISIS. And to do so in a way that allows that ISIS doesn't go back in Syria, as we were just talking about here.  That is the fundamental problem going forward. We have a president — and Hillary Clinton was a part of this, by the way, who has made political decisions for our men and women in uniform. I want the men and women at home to know, if I'm commander-in-chief, I will only send you into harm's way when our national security is at risk. And if we do, you know you'll have our full support, the support of the American people, and you'll have a clear path for victory. [applause]  	False	True	2
WALKER	... a lot of those people, though, and I'm going to echo what Senator Rubio just said. This is an issue where, we're talking about my state, it's thousands of manufacturing jobs. Thousands of manufacturing jobs for a rule the Obama administration, own EPA has said will have a marginal impact on climate change.  So we're going to put thousands and thousands of jobs in my state, I think it's something like 30,000 in Ohio, other states across this country, we're going to put people — manufacturing jobs, the kind of jobs that are far greater than minimum wage, this administration is willing to put at risk for something its own EPA says is marginal (ph)...  	False	True	2
WALKER	First of all, I got to say to Carson, Huckabee, thanks a lot for making the rest of us look like chumps up here, but, I'd pick Clara Barton. I once worked for the American Red Cross, she was a great founder of the Red Cross.  	False	True	2
WALKER	Harley. I love riding Harley's.  	False	True	2
WALKER	Well, I turned 13 years old two days before Ronald Reagan was first elected. A lot of people forget this, but just a few days before that election 1980, he was behind in the polls.  And I think what changed things was people in America realized they didn't want to hear what was bad about America, they wanted to know how it was going to be better. Ronald Reagan wasn't just a conservative Republican, he was an eternal optimist in the American people.  And I am too. So here's what I think will make America better. We need to live in a world where our children are free, are free from the threats of radical Islamic terrorism.  We need to live in an America where we have an economy, where everyone can live their piece of the American dream, no matter what that dream is. And we need to live in an America where we have a federal government that is not too big to fail, but ultimately small enough to succeed, where we send powers back to the states and back to the people.  That's what I did in Wisconsin. We took on the big government union bosses, the big government special interests, many of whom came in from Washington, to spend millions of dollars to try and take me out because we stood up to them, we didn't back down in any of those instances.  If you give me the chance as your next president, I won't back down any day, anyway, anyhow. I'll fight and win for you and your families every single day I'm in office. [applause]  	False	True	2
MALE	And, by the way, Carl...  (APPLAUSE)  	False	True	3

MITCHELL	"Thank you, Lester.  Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders favors what he calls ""Medicare for all."" Now, you said that what he is proposing would tear up Obamacare and replace it.  Secretary Clinton, is it fair to say to say that Bernie Sanders wants to kill Obamacare?  "	True	False	4
MITCHELL	Senator Sanders?  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	Governor — Governor Sanders...  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	Senator Sanders, let me ask you this, though...  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	... you've talked about Medicare for all...  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	.. and tonight you've released a very detailed plan, just two...  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	... well, two hours before the debate, you did.  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	But let me ask you about Vermont. Because in Vermont — you tried in the state of Vermont, and Vermont walked away from this kind of idea, of — of Medicare for all, single-payer, because they concluded it would require major tax increases...  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	... and by some estimates, it would double the budget. If you couldn't sell it in Vermont, Senator...  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	... how can you sell it to the country?  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	Senator Sanders — Senator Sanders, you've talked a lot about things you want to do. You want free education for everyone, you want the Federal Minimum Wage raised to $15 an hour. You want to expand Social Security...  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	... benefits. You've been specific about what you want, but let's talk about how to pay for all this. You now said that you would raise taxes today, two hours or so ago, you said you would raise taxes to pay for your health care plan. You haven't been specific about how to pay for the other things...  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	... Will you tell us tonight?  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	... OK...  O'MALLEY: ... The only person on this stage who has...  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	... Secretary Clinton, you mentioned earlier — Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	OK, we're out of time. Senator Sanders,  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	Senator Sanders...  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	... Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question about taxes.  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	The most googled political issue...  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	In the last month was taxes. Now, in your healthcare plan, the plan you released tonight, you would not only raise taxes on the wealthy, but the details you released indicate you would raise taxes on the middle class also. Is that correct?  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	Senator — Senator, let me just follow up on that.  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	On Meet the Press on December 20th, you said that you would only raise taxes on the middle class to pay for family leave. And, having said that, now you say you're going to raise middle class taxes to pay for healthcare as well. Is that breaking your word?  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	"Thank you Lester.  Senator Sanders, the nuclear deal is now enforced. Iran is getting it's billions of dollars, several Americans who have been held are now going to be heading home. The president said today, ""it's a good day. It's a good day for diplomacy. It's a time now to restore diplomatic relations for the first time since 1979 and actually re- opened a U.S. Embassy in Tehran.""  "	True	False	4
MITCHELL	Your response Secretary Clinton?  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	You mentioned Syria. Let me ask you about Syria, all of you. Let's turn to Syria and the civil war that has been raging there. Are there any circumstances in which you could see deploying significant numbers of ground forces in Syria, not just specials forces but significant ground forces to combat ISIS in a direct combat role?  Let me start with you Secretary Clinton.  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	Senator Sanders, ground forces yes or no?  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	Governor O'Malley?  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	"Governor O'Malley.  O'MALLEY: Thank you. [applause]  Andrea, governors have led us to victory in two world wars by doing what America does best, and that is by joining forces with others by acting in coalition. And I believe that President Obama is doing the right thing in this case.  We need to learn the lessons from the past. We do need to provide the special — special ops advisers, we need — do need to provide the technical support, but over the long-term, we need to develop new alliances. We need a much more proactive national security strategy that reduces these threats before they rise to a level where it feels like we need to pull for a division of marines.  And I also want to add one other thing here. I appreciate the fact that in our debate, we don't use the term you hear Republicans throwing around trying to look all vibrato and macho sending other kids — kids into combat, they keep using the term boots on the ground. A woman in Burlington, Iowa said to me, ""Governor, when you're with your colleagues, please don't refer to my son who has served two tours of duty in Iraq as a pair of boots on the ground."" Now, we need to be mindful of learning the lessons of the past. [applause]  "	True	False	4
MITCHELL	I have a question. I have a question for Senator Sanders. Did the policies of the Obama administration, in which Secretary Clinton of course was a part, create a vacuum in Iraq and Syria that helped ISIS grow?  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	Secretary Clinton, I want to talk to you about red lines, because former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a recent interview that President Obama's decision to stand down on planned missile strikes against Damascus after Assad had used chemical weapons hurt the president's credibility. Should the president have stuck to his red line once he drew it?  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	But should he — should he have stuck to his...  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	... line? Did it hurt U.S. credibility?  	True	False	4

MITCHELL	Senator Sanders.  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	Your time is us. Lester.  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	Just a — just a quick follow-up, though, Secretary Clinton. Just a moment, Governor.  O'MALLEY: Andrea, when can I get my 30 seconds?  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	But — but — Secretary Clinton, you said that the leaders from the intelligence community went to Silicon Valley, they were flatly turned down. They got nowhere.  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	"Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question. You called Bill Clinton's past transgressions, quote, ""totally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable."" Senator, do you regret saying that?  "	True	False	4
MITCHELL	: You didn't have to answer it that way, though. Why did you?  	True	False	4
MITCHELL	...too long.  O'MALLEY: I believe there are many issues. I have 60 seconds for this?  	True	False	4
HEWITT	Senator Cruz, you've said you disagree with Mr. Trump's policy. I don't want a cage match; you've tweeted you don't want a cage match. But Republican primary voters deserve to know, with the kind of specificity and responsiveness you delivered in your nine Supreme Court arguments, how you disagree with Mr. Trump. Would you spell that out with us?  	False	True	5
HEWITT	So you're saying you disagree because he's too broad and you have a narrower focus? Why do you disagree with him?  	False	True	5
HEWITT	Carly Fiorina... [applause] ... this is the Christmas dinner debate. This will be the debate that Americans talk about at Christmas. And thus far, in the first 10 minutes, we haven't heard a lot about Ronald Reagan's city on a hill. We've heard a lot about keeping Americans out or keeping Americans safe and everyone else out. Is this what you want the party to stand for?  	False	True	5
HEWITT	Dr. Carson...[applause]... you mentioned in your opening remarks that you're a pediatric neurologist surgeon...  	False	True	5
HEWITT	Neurosurgeon. And people admire and respect and are inspired by your life story, your kindness, your evangelical core support. We're talking about ruthless things tonight — carpet bombing, toughness, war. And people wonder, could you do that? Could you order air strikes that would kill innocent children by not the scores, but the hundreds and the thousands? Could you wage war as a commander-in-chief?  	False	True	5
HEWITT	So you are OK with the deaths of thousands of innocent children and civilian? It's like...  	False	True	5
HEWITT	That is what war — can you be as ruthless as Churchill was in prosecuting the war against the Nazis?  	False	True	5
HEWITT	Mr. Trump, we are talking about the most important thing, that's why it's heated. And it's, you are OK with Mr. Assad staying in power, but you are also in favor of winning.  If he stays in power, Iran is winning, Hezbollah is winning. Iran is winning in Yemen. They are winning everywhere. If they are winning how can we be winning?  	False	True	5
HEWITT	Governor Christie, is he right? Because if we step back, Iran goes nuclear. Is Donald Trump right?  	False	True	5
HEWITT	Senator Paul, let me ask you, you heard Governor Kasich say Assad must go. Do you agree?  	False	True	5
HEWITT	Governor Bush, a commander-in-chief question. You've said that Mr. Trump is not qualified to be president because he's not qualified to deal with Vladimir Putin. Why are you better qualified to deal with Vladimir Putin than Mr. Trump?  	False	True	5

HEWITT	Dr. Carson, commander-in-chief question again. You've been the head of neurosurgery for a big hospital. You're on a lot of boards of a lot of companies. You've traveled the world. You're going traveling again next week. But does that prepare you to command troops from Djibouti to Japan, troops from Afghanistan to Iraq to be in charge of the men and women watching on Armed Services Network tonight?  	False	True	5
HEWITT	Mr. Trump...[applause]... Dr. Carson just referenced the single most important job of the president, the command, the control and the care of our nuclear forces. And he mentioned the triad. The B-52s are older than I am. The missiles are old. The submarines are aging out. It's an executive order. It's a commander-in-chief decision.  What's your priority among our nuclear triad?  	False	True	5
HEWITT	Of the three legs of the triad, though, do you have a priority? I want to go to Senator Rubio after that and ask him.  	False	True	5
HEWITT	Senator Rubio, do you have a response?  	False	True	5
HEWITT	My listeners tell me again and again they are worried that Hillary Clinton will win the White House because you'll run as an independent. Are you ready to assure Republicans tonight that you will run as a Republican and abide by the decision of the Republicans?  	False	True	5
HEWITT	Dr. Carson, last week...  	False	True	5
HEWITT	Please.  	False	True	5
HEWITT	Dr. Carson, Mr. Trump just committed to stay the distance regardless of the result. How about you?  	False	True	5
MUIR	Good evening, again, everyone. This is the first time since Iowa and the only time before the New Hampshire primary that the Republican candidates will have the opportunity to face each other.  The people of Iowa have been heard. Now it's New Hampshire's turn. In just three days, voters here will decide who they think should be the Republican nominee for president.  	False	True	8
MUIR	So let's welcome the candidates for the Republican nomination for president.  New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. [applause]  	False	True	8
MUIR	Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [applause]  	False	True	8
MUIR	Florida Senator Marco Rubio. [applause]  	False	True	8
MUIR	And Ohio Governor John Kasich. [applause]  	False	True	8
MUIR	And Dr. Ben Carson, please come out on the stage. He's standing there, as well. Dr. Carson. [applause]  	False	True	8
MUIR	And lastly, we welcome back to the debate stage, Donald Trump. [applause]  	False	True	8
MUIR	It was so noisy in here. Yes. Yes. We're going to introduce Ohio Governor John kasich. [applause]  The applause so loud here in the hall.  	False	True	8
MUIR	"So let's get started. We welcome you all to the debate stage here tonight. We're going to tackle the issues Americans are most concerned about, the economy, ISIS, Homeland Security. And here in New Hampshire, some of the most heated rhetoric yet over who is best suited to step in on day one, who has the experience, who has the temperament to be commander-in-chief.  Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz has said about you right here in New Hampshire this week, quote, ""I don't know anyone who would be comfortable with someone who behaves this way, having his finger on the button. We're liable to wake up one morning, and if he were president, he would nuke Denmark."" Saying, quote, ""That's temperament of a leader to keep this country safe.""  I wanted to give you the opportunity to respond to this and to tell the American people tonight why you do have the temperament to be commander-in-chief.  "	False	True	8
MUIR	Mr. Trump, thank you. I want to bring this to Senator Cruz, then.  Because Senator, you did said of Trump's behavior this week, that's not the temperament of a leader to keep this country safe.  Why not?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Senator Cruz, I did ask about Mr. Trump. You said he doesn't have the temperament to be commander-in-chief. Do you stand by those words?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Senator Cruz, thank you. We're going to continue on this notion of readiness and experience. I'm going to come back.  	False	True	8
MUIR	If you would like to respond, Mr. Trump.  	False	True	8
MUIR	"Mr. Trump, thank you. And we're going to continue on this notion of readiness and on experience, but I want to ask about a headline that was back in the papers again this morning.  Dr. Carson, on the day of the Iowa caucuses, the Cruz campaign sent out messages and voicemails saying, quote, ""Breaking news. Dr. Ben Carson will be planning to suspend his campaign following tonight's caucuses. Please inform any Carson caucus-goers of this news.""  But as we can all see, you are still standing here tonight. Late this week, your campaign sent this e-mail, quote, ""This kind of deceitful behavior is why the American people don't trust politicians. If Senator Cruz does not act, then he clearly represents D.C. values.""  What kind of action do you think Senator Cruz should take?  "	False	True	8
MUIR	Senator Cruz. [applause]  Dr. Carson, thank you.  Senator Cruz, you have said that Dr. Carson and his wife have become friends of yours. I'm curious as why you didn't call ahead of time to either the doctor or his wife or have your campaign check in with the other campaign before sending out those messages.  	False	True	8
MUIR	Senator Cruz, thank you.  We're going to move on here. Back to the issues...  	False	True	8
MUIR	Dr. Carson, please.  	False	True	8
MUIR	"Dr. Carson, thank you. Thank you, doctor.  Senator Rubio. I want to stay on the issue of readiness to be president and experience and questions about you being a first-term senator.  Governor Christie warning voters here in New Hampshire against voting for another first-term senator as America did with Barack Obama in 2008. Arguing that you are, quote, "" not ready to be president of the United States.""  And Senator Santorum, who we all know, dropped out of the race and endorsed you, had a hard time when asked on national television, listing your accomplishments as senator. Tonight, what are your accomplishments in the Senate that demonstrate you are ready to be president of the United States?  "	False	True	8
MUIR	Senator Rubio, thank you. [applause]  I do want to ask Governor Christie, Governor Christie, you said fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me when it comes to electing a first-term senator. You heard Senator Rubio make the case that he does have the experience. Your response?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Governor, thank you. Senator Rubio?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Senator Rubio, thank you. I want to bring in governor bush on this, because you...  	False	True	8
MUIR	... have made this...  	False	True	8
MUIR	If you'd like to respond to economic...  	False	True	8
MUIR	Senator Rubio?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Governor Christie, we will — we will...  	False	True	8
MUIR	Governor Christie — thank you, Governor. I will mention — listen...  	False	True	8
MUIR	... Listen, people... [applause]  Governor Bush, I'll mention your name so that you can come in on this...  	False	True	8
MUIR	"I want to bring you in on this because you've made this central to your campaign right here in New Hampshire in the last couple of days. Four Years ago you said of Senator Rubio, he was ready to be Vice President. You spoke of his experience as well. You said he has the fortitude to be a good President, but just this week you said Senator Rubio accomplished, quote, ""nothing"" in the Senate. How do you square the two?  "	False	True	8
MUIR	... We're going to continue with leadership now. Martha?  	False	True	8
MUIR	"Martha, we're going to turn to immigration now. And I want to bring in Governor Kasich because you told us in an ABC interview, Governor, quote, ""It is completely ridiculous to think we are going to go into neighborhoods, grab people out of their homes and ship people back to Mexico."" Adding, quote, ""That's not where the party is. The party is not for departing 11.5 million people.""  But Mr. Trump and Senator Cruz, who have made deportation central to their campaigns, top the national polls. So, my question for you, are you not where the voters are?  "	False	True	8
MUIR	"Governor Kasich, thank you. [applause]  I want to bring this next to Senator Cruz. You heard what the governor said. He said, ""We need practical solutions."" And you've said, ""I don't intend to send jack boots to knock on doors. That's not how we enforce the law for any crime.""  So, what is your plan? How will you deport 11.5 million undocumented people? And be specific. How would you do it?  "	False	True	8
MUIR	Let me just ask you this, though, because Governor Kasich was talking about the families and what you do with the families that you would have to send home.  Can you tell the American people tonight how you would do that?  	False	True	8
MUIR	"Senator Cruz, thank you. I want to bring in Senator Rubio.  This question is about immigration, it is also about leadership. You're aware of the criticism from many candidates on this stage tonight that you co-authored the so-called Gang of Eight bill that would have created a path to citizenship for people here illegally.  Governor Christie has said of you, as soon as you felt the heat, you turned tail and run. Governor Bush has said, ""I don't think we need people cutting and running anymore.""  Did you fight for your own legislation, Senator, or did you run from it?  "	False	True	8
MUIR	But I'm asking, did you fight for the legislation at the time or did you run from it as you're...  	False	True	8
MUIR	Governor Christie?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Governor thank you.  Senator Rubio?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Senator Rubio, thank you. We want to turn to health care in this country, and for that, author and commentator, Mary Katherine Ham tonight.  	False	True	8
MUIR	Mary Katherine, thank you. We want to turn now to the issue of eminent domain, which is being debated right here in New Hampshire. And Josh McElveen is the political director and the anchor of WMUR TV. Josh?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Josh, thank you.  When we come back here tonight, jobs, ISIS, and what it means to be a conservative. [applause]  The Republican debate continues right here from New Hampshire on ABC. We'll be right back.  [commercial break]  	False	True	8
MUIR	"And, we welcome you back to the Republican debate from New Hampshire tonight here on ABC. We're going to turn now to what it means to be a conservative, and I want to turn to Governor Kasich.  Governor, while campaigning here in New Hampshire, you were already asked about groans from some conservatives after your endorsements from the New York Times, and the Boston Globe. You said, quote, ""What conservatives have to know is they have to say, look isn't it nice to have a conservative like me liked? And, maybe the ought to think about it because if I get elected president, the Republican party and the definition of conservatism is going to change.""  How would you change conservatism?  "	False	True	8
MUIR	Governor Kasich, thank you.  Mr. Trump, you've heard the argument from many of the candidates on this stage that you're not a true conservative. Tell the voters watching tonight why you are.  	False	True	8
MUIR	Mr. Trump, thank you. [applause]  Senator Rubio, you have said yourself that you don't think Donald Trump is running as a conservative. Did he convince you?  	False	True	8
MUIR	"Senator Rubio, thank you. I want to turn this discussion to the economy now.  And Mr. Trump, Governor Christie has said, ""I tell everybody who goes to a Donald Trump event, if you get to ask a question, just ask him how."" Christie said, ""I don't care which of the things he talks about, just ask him how."" You have said that you'd be the greatest jobs president God ever created. Tell Americans watching tonight how many jobs you would create in the first term and how.  "	False	True	8
MUIR	"Mr. Trump, thank you.  There are a lot of governors on this stage tonight and Governor Christie, Governor Kasich said of you, quote, ""In Ohio, we balanced a budget. They don't have one over in New Jersey. Our credit has been strengthened. Their credit has been downgraded. We've got more jobs.""  How important are those metrics in choosing the next president? And is his job — is his record on jobs, I should say, actually stronger than yours?  "	False	True	8
MUIR	Thank you, Governor.  Governor Kasich?  	False	True	8
MUIR	He didn't say your record was better than his.  	False	True	8
MUIR	Governor Kasich, thank you.  	False	True	8
MUIR	Governor Kasich, thank you. I do want to turn from jobs to taxes.  	False	True	8
MUIR	If you would like to respond to the governor, you can.  	False	True	8
MUIR	I'm coming to you next with a question, anyway. You can respond to that question.  	False	True	8
MUIR	We're going from jobs to taxes, and here's the...  	False	True	8
MUIR	To the Gang of Eight bill first?  	False	True	8
MUIR	The governor wasn't talking about the president, he was talking about the Gang of Eight bill. [applause]  	False	True	8
MUIR	So, let me ask you about taxes, Senator Rubio.  	False	True	8
MUIR	A recent poll, 68 percent of Americans favor raising taxes on people making more than $1 million a year. Are they wrong?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Senator Rubio, thank you.  I want to bring in Governor Bush. And Governor, I just want to repeat that number for you — 68 percent of Americans favor raising taxes on people making more than a million.  What do you say to the people who believe that tonight?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Knew that was coming. Governor, thank you.  	False	True	8
MUIR	Governor Christie, thank you. [applause] Martha?  	False	True	8
MUIR	"Martha, thank you. We're just going to — we're going to stay on ISIS here and the war on terror, because as you know, there's been a debate in this country about how to deal with the enemy and about enhanced interrogation techniques ever since 9/11.  So Senator Cruz, you have said, quote, ""torture is wrong, unambiguously, period. Civilized nations do not engage in torture."" Some of the other candidates say they don't think waterboarding is torture. Mr. Trump has said, I would bring it back. Senator Cruz, is waterboarding torture?  "	False	True	8
MUIR	If elected president, would you bring it back?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Senator Cruz, thank you. Mr. Trump, you said not only does it work, but that you'd bring it back.  	False	True	8
MUIR	Mr. Trump, thank you. Governor Bush, you have said that you won't rule waterboarding out. Congress has passed laws banning the use of waterboarding by the military and the CIA, as you know. Would you want Congress to change that if you're elected president?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Governor Bush, thank you. [applause]  Senator Rubio, I do want to ask you, you have said that you do not want to telegraph to the enemy what you would do as commander in chief. But for the American people watching tonight who want to know where the next president will stand, do you believe waterboarding is torture?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Senator Rubio, thank you.  We want to turn now to the topic of executive orders, and for that, we're going to turn back to Mary Katharine Ham. Mary Katharine?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Mary Katherine, thank you.  We want to turn to something the governor of New Hampshire said... [laughter]  	False	True	8
MUIR	A connection here on the stage. We're going to move on to what the governor of New Hampshire said just this week, and that is that heroin overdose is not the second-leading cause of death in this state. You don't need me to tell you that. But there's another number, 48 percent of the people here in this state knows someone who has abused heroin.  Josh, who covers this for WMUR, has the next question.  	False	True	8
MUIR	Martha?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Governor, well come to you in the next segment.  When we come back, questions about race, about our veterans and social issues what younger conservative voters are now saying as we continue with New Hampshire with the Republican debate, right here on ABC.  [commercial break]  	False	True	8
MUIR	Welcome back to New Hampshire, ABC News coverage of the Republican debate, and it's great to have you back at the podiums, and we want to turn to race in America.  And Mr. Trump, there are many who argue cell phones and smartphones are just now exposing what's been happening in this country for years. Cases of excessive force against minorities.  As you know, Mr. Trump, on the other side, the FBI director recently said there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement because of increased scrutiny. You have said police are the most mistreated people in America. As president, how do you bridge the divide?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Great. Mr. Trump, I did ask about bridging the divide though as president. So what would you say to the American families who say we have lived through this, we have seen excessive force? What would you say to those people?  	False	True	8
MUIR	I do want to ask — Governor Kasich?  	False	True	8
MUIR	"Governor, thank you. Senator Rubio, I want to ask you next, President Obama visited a mosque this week in America for the first time in his presidency. President George W. Bush visited a mosque after September 11th. You said of President Obama, quote, ""he's always pitting people against each other."" So I'm curious, how are the two visits different, and would you visit a mosque as president?  "	False	True	8
MUIR	Senator Rubio, thank you. Martha?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Josh, thank you. I want to turn to a family that New Hampshire voters know quite well, and Senator Cruz, the issue of hostages has been a very real and painful one here in this state.  As we all know, James Foley was killed. His mother, Diane, said our government should be willing to negotiate, arguing that families should also be allowed to raise money for ransom. What would you say to Diane Foley tonight? Should families be allowed to raise money for ransom for their loved ones?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Senator Cruz, thank you. Mr. Trump, what would you say to Diane Foley? Should families be allowed to raise money for ransom?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Mr. Trump, thank you.  We want to turn now to social issues and young voters and for the question, from Mary Katherine.  	False	True	8
MUIR	Mary Katherine, thank you.  We're going to have closing statements here in just a moment, but before we go, quick lightning round. Come November, two battle-ground states, but they face off tomorrow in the Super Bowl.  Governor Kasich, who wins? [laughter]  	False	True	8
MUIR	Governor Bush?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Senator Rubio?  	False	True	8
MUIR	[inaudible] Mr. Trump?  	False	True	8
MUIR	All right, Dr. Carson?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Yeah. Governor Christie, the last word?  	False	True	8
MUIR	Denver. Thank you so much, gentlemen.  Closing statements in just a moment, right here, as the ABC News Republican debate continues from New Hampshire, right after this.  [commercial break]  	False	True	8
MUIR	We welcome you back. The New Hampshire primary, of course, is Tuesday, but time now for closing statements. And we begin tonight with Governor Kasich.  	False	True	8
MUIR	Governor Bush.  	False	True	8
MUIR	Thank you, Dr. Carson. Senator Rubio.  	False	True	8
MUIR	Thank you. Mr. Trump.  	False	True	8
MUIR	Mr. Trump, thank you. Thanks to all the candidates on the stage here tonight. We thank the people of Manchester, New Hampshire for having this debate, and to everyone at home. The New Hampshire primary is Tuesday.	False	True	8
HAM	Thanks, David.  Good evening, guys.  	False	True	8
HAM	Mr. Trump.  	False	True	8
HAM	"In the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton has criticized Bernie Sanders' plan for single payer government health care, noting it would require big, across the board tax increases for Americans. In doing so, she's doubling down on Obamacare, despite its persistent unpopularity.  Mr. Trump, you have said you want to appeal Obamacare. You have also said, quote, ""Everybody's got to be covered,"" adding, quote, ""The government's going to pay for it."" Are you closer to Bernie Sanders' vision for health care than Hillary Clinton's?  "	False	True	8
HAM	Dr. Carson, you have some experience with this matter. In the past, you have said that Obamacare should be replaced before it's repealed. How and why?  	False	True	8
HAM	Thank you, Dr. Carson. David, Martha, back to you.  	False	True	8
HAM	Thanks, David. Senator Cruz, on the campaign trail you've promised voters a lot, in fact if you're elected president you'd say you end Common Core immediately, abolish the IRS, and do away with sanctuary cities. You've also been a persistent critic of President Obama's executive overreach, going it alone, not working with Congress. How do you intend to implement this aggressive agenda within your Constitutional authority, especially given that it would require working with Congress and Washington players with whom you're happy to say you have a strained relationship?  	False	True	8
HAM	Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz is known for opposing deals, you literally wrote the book on making them. Senator Cruz has mentioned that on the trail. What would you say to those conservatives that are concerned that a deal maker will just perpetuate the same deals in Washington and the way that things run now [inaudible]...  	False	True	8
HAM	Governor Kasich, is the problem with Washington that there are too many deals, or too few?  	False	True	8
HAM	Thank you, governors. Martha and David, back to you.  	False	True	8
HAM	Thank you David.  Senator Rubio. One of the lazier pieces of political conventional wisdom is that so-called social issues are hurting Republicans with young people. But on the two most prominent social issues, polling with millennials actually moves in different directions.  On one hand, it is clear, young people across the political spectrum increasingly favor same sex marriage. However young voters have not moved to the left on abortion. In fact, large numbers of them favor at least some modest restrictions that conservatives have supported. How do you speak to millennials on both these issues, while Democrats will inevitable charge intolerance and extremism?  	False	True	8
HAM	Governor Bush? I want to come to you. Your allies have recently attacked Senator Rubio for being too pro-life to be elected in November. You made a similar charge stating it in an interview. This is a pro-life party. Do you stand behind that criticism?  	False	True	8
HAM	Governor Christie. You too, have talked about Senator Rubio's position on the life issue. Some conservative activists have called this line of attack harmful to the pro-life cause.  	False	True	8
HAM	Thank you, all. Back to you, David and Martha. [applause]  	False	True	8
WALLACE	Tonight, we're partnering with Google for an exclusive second-screen experience. Search Fox News debate on Google any time in the next two hours to access exclusive content.  You can see the campaigns respond to the debate in real time, and you can weigh in by voting on the topics being discussed. Just go to google.com or open your Google search app and type in Fox News debate.  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson. [applause]  Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. [applause]  New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. [applause]  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Apparently Iowa's near Kentucky.  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Senator Rubio, I want to explore this sort of larger issue. The campaign has in a sense turned into a battle for the soul of the Republican party: establishment versus grassroots, pragmatic versus principle. You say that you can unite all of the factions inside the GOP. How?  	False	True	7
WALLACE	"Governor Kasich, I want to get back to this question of where conservatives are this year. You call yourself a, quote, ""inside-outside guy, a reformer who knows how to get things done,"" but you reject the establishment label.  First question is why do you reject it? And secondly, what do you say to Republican voters this year who view practical government experience as a liability and not an asset?  "	False	True	7
WALLACE	Dr. Carson, I want to pick up on that with you. Governor Kasich likes to say he knows how to land the plane. You've landed a lot of planes in the O.R. But what about the idea of running for president with no experience in government at all?  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Gentlemen, we're now going to start to drill down into specific issues that are on voters' minds. I'm going to start with one of the biggest ones, which is foreign terror.  According to Google, ISIS was by far the most searched foreign policy topic over the last year. Senator Cruz, you talk tough about fighting terrorism. You talk about carpet bombing into oblivion. You talk about seeing if the sand will glow at night. But critics say that your record does not match up to that. You opposed giving President Obama authority to enforce his red line in Syria. Three years in a row now, you have voted against the Defense Authorization Act.  How do you square your rhetoric with your record, sir?  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Senator Rubio, does Senator Cruz's record match his rhetoric?  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Senator Cruz, you've got 30 seconds. You were mentioned. [applause]  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Gentlemen.  	False	True	7
WALLACE	May I — may I just say, we are going to continue the questions about foreign terror, gentlemen, right after this break.  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Thank you. Governor Christie, you have compared both Senators Cruz and Rubio to Barack Obama, saying that we cannot afford another inexperienced President. You've also said that Senator Cruz's vote to curtail the NSA surveillance program made America less safe. Is either of them ready to be Commander in Chief?  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Governor Bush...  	False	True	7
WALLACE	... I don't think that your name was mentioned...  	False	True	7
WALLACE	... Sir, I think — I think the question was...  	False	True	7
WALLACE	... It's not my question that you get a chance to respond to, it's his answer. [laughter]  You don't get 30 seconds to respond to me...  	False	True	7
WALLACE	... You don't get 30 seconds to respond to me...  	False	True	7
WALLACE	... If I could go on. Sir, I know you like to argue about the rules, but we're going to conduct a debate...  	False	True	7
WALLACE	... Governor Bush...  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Governor Bush, here's the question — I'm going to ask Governor Bush the question.  You criticized several candidates in this field on this stage for what you call unrealistic ideas about how to fight terrorists, including Rubio, and Cruz on the issue of their refusing to give the President authority to enforce the redline in Syria.  But, given the fact that your brother got us into two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that have still not ended.  That have still not ended, what lessons have you learned from his mistakes, sir?  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Senator Cruz, now you get a chance to respond.  	False	True	7
WALLACE	... It is a debate, sir.  	False	True	7
WALLACE	I think the questions were about issues. Senator Rubio, what would you like to respond sir... [applause]  [crosstalk]  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Thank you.  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Good.  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Senator Paul, go ahead.  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Well... [crosstalk] ... we'll be talking about foreign policy a little bit later. We're going to talk...  	False	True	7
WALLACE	This debate is just getting started. Coming up, the role of the federal government. But first, join tonight's conversation right from your home. Go to google.com or open your Google search app and search Fox News Debate to vote on which issue is most important to you in this election. More from the Iowa Events Center and the Republican presidential debate in a moment. [applause]  [commercial break]  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Gentlemen, we're going to turn now to what we call electability, issues that you're either facing in the primaries or issues that you're certainly going to face in a general election. So you may not be altogether unhappy if you're not included in this round. [laughter]  Senator Cruz, you pride yourself on standing up to the D.C. cartel, but as we've seen to a certain degree tonight, there's a price for standing up to the D.C. cartel. Thirteen Republican senators have endorsed other candidates, none have endorsed you.  You — twice last year, you asked for a colleague to second a motion, a routine courtesy on the Senate floor, and no senator would do it. Top GOP officials worry that if you're at the top of the ticket — some officials — that not only will you lose the White House, but it will tank the ticket all the way down the line.  The question is does your style sometimes get in the way of your ability to get things done, sir?  	False	True	7
WALLACE	"Governor Christie, two of your former top aides go on trial in May for fraud and conspiracy in the ""Bridge-gate"" case, the politically motivated closure of lanes to the George Washington Bridge.  Another former aide who has already pleaded guilty and will likely testify for the government, as you know, says that you knew about this whole deal. Can the GOP take the chance of nominating you with this scandal still out there, sir?  "	False	True	7
WALLACE	Gentlemen, almost 60% of Republican caucus-goers identify themselves as Evangelicals, so I'd like to spend a few minutes exploring social issues.  Governor Kasich, you talk a good deal about your faith. In fact, you say it played a role in your decision to expand Medicaid, and you say that when you meet Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates, he's going to ask what you did for the poor, not what you did to keep government small.  Senator Cruz is on the opposite side of this issue from you, so does that mean that you're getting in and he isn't? [laughter]  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Gentlemen, we had a case study on religious liberty just this last summer. A county clerk in Kentucky named Kim Davis refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court ruling, saying that it violated her religious beliefs.  Governor Christie, you said that she must follow the law or be moved to another job that would be in keeping with her conscience. But some conservatives say that that violates her religious liberty.  	False	True	7
WALLACE	"Thank you, sir.  Senator Rubio, during the last debate, you said Governor Christie had changed his position and his mind on gun control, on common core, and backing President Obama's nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. He said you're wrong on the facts and you can't, quote, ""slime your way to the White House."" I assume in the last two weeks, you've done some fact-checking. Do you want to take anything back?  "	False	True	7
WALLACE	Thank you, senator.  Senator Paul, in May on the campaign trail you, said you didn't get into politics to fight about abortion. You said you were more concerned about the national debt. Your answer is to turn abortion back to the states the way it was before Roe v. Wade.  Does that mean that if a liberal state, let's say, wants to make abortion legal, that you're okay with that and what do you say to conservative voters who believe deeply that abortion is murder?  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Sir, just 30 seconds to answer my specific... [applause]  Just 30 seconds to answer my specific question. Do you favor the idea that abortion should be a states' rights issue and if a liberal state wants to make it legal, that that's their choice? Yes or no?  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Thank you, sir. [applause]  	False	True	7
WALLACE	We're not finished yet. More to come from the presidential debate, live from Des Moines, Iowa, next. And remember, to see how the campaigns are responding to the debate in real time, go togoogle.com or open your Google search app and search Fox News debate, and please stay with us. [commercial break] [applause]  	False	True	7
WALLACE	We have another question from one of Youtube's top creators. Here it is.  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Governor Bush, how do you answer Nabela?  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Governor, thank you. Senator Cruz, change of subject. You called for an end to the renewable fuel standards which mandate that refineries blend biofuels, including ethanol into gasoline. As you well know, ethanol's a big industry in this state, $10 billion dollars a year.  Last week, Terry Branstad, the popular Governor of Iowa... [applause] ... Who is in the hall tonight, said that you're bankrolled by big oil, and that Iowa voters would be making a mistake supporting you. Why should those voters side with you over the six- term governor of the state, sir?  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Dr. Carson, I'd like to ask you about exactly that issue. Where are you on the mandatory ethanol standard, and precisely this question. Should government be in the business of picking winners and losers, or should it be left to the market place?  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Doctor, thank you.  	False	True	7
WALLACE	Dr. Ben Carson.  	False	True	7
WALLACE	And don't forget, after all the talk, the first voting of the 2016 campaign happens in just four days. The first Americans to vote, the Iowa caucuses are Monday and Fox News will have complete coverage.  	False	True	7
BAKER	The candidates on stage tonight were selected based on their standing in an average of four national polls. Those standings determining their position on the stage. And here they are. At center stage, businessman Donald Trump. [applause]  Neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson. [applause]  	False	True	4
BAKER	Tonight's rules are simple. Up to 90 second for each answer. One minute for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over their allotted time, you'll here this.  	False	True	4
BAKER	Ms. Fiorina, while you've all pointed out how weak the current recovery has been and how disappointing by any historical standards, in the general election, the Democrats will inevitably ask you and voters to compare the recent president's jobs performance.  Now, in seven years under President Obama, the U.S. has added an average of 107,000 jobs a month. Under President Clinton, the economy added about 240,000 jobs a month. Under George W. Bush, it was only 13,000 a month. If you win the nomination, you'll probably be facing a Democrat named Clinton. How are you going to respond to the claim that Democratic presidents are better at creating jobs than Republicans?  	False	True	4
BAKER	Thank you. Thank you. Senator Paul, income inequality has been rising in the United States. Fifty years ago, for example, the average CEO of a big corporation in this country earned 20 times the average salary of one of his or her workers. Today, that CEO earns about 300 times the average salary of a worker. Does it matter at all that the gap between the rich and everyone else is widening?  	False	True	4
BAKER	Thank you, Senator.  	False	True	4
BAKER	Senator Rubio...  	False	True	4
BAKER	Yes, one quick comment, yes.  	False	True	4
BAKER	Governor Bush...  	False	True	4
BAKER	Governor — Governor, you...You should let Jeb speak.  	False	True	4
BAKER	Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, you yourself — you yourself said let Governor Bush speak. Governor Bush?  	False	True	4
BAKER	Senator Rubio? Senator...  	False	True	4
BAKER	Senator Rubio, Senator Rubio, let me — let me take you to a question that I think gets to the root of a lot of the anxiety that people have in this country. The economy is undergoing a transformation through information technology. Americans are anxious that the new economy isn't producing higher-paying jobs. Many are concerned that the new wealth seems to be going mainly to innovators and investors.  Meanwhile, with factories run by robots and shopping done increasingly on smartphones, many traditional jobs are just going away. How do you reassure American workers that their jobs are not being steadily replaced by machines?  	False	True	4
BAKER	Thank you. Senator Cruz — Senator Cruz, entitlements. You've argued for raising the retirement age and reducing benefits for future retirees, but reducing any sort of benefits for the elderly has always been notoriously hard to do politically. When Speaker Paul Ryan proposed replacing traditional Medicare with federally funded private plans a few years ago, a liberal group responded with a commercial that featured a granny being pushed off a cliff.  What's going to be different this time?  	False	True	4
BAKER	...I said for future retirees was your statement... [applause]  	False	True	4
BAKER	Senator Rubio. Can I just come to Senator Rubio? We're coming to you, Mr. Trump, in one second. I — I promise.  	False	True	4
BAKER	Senator Rubio, your tax plan includes a large expansion of child tax credits to raise off (ph) the tax incomes for low-income parents. A similar tax credit that you previously proposed in the Senate was estimated to cost as much as $170 billion a year, according to the Tax Foundation.  Isn't — isn't there a risk you're just adding another expensive entitle program to an already overburdened federal budget?  	False	True	4
BAKER	Governor Kasich? Let me come to Governor Kasich.  	False	True	4
BAKER	Governor Kasich.  [crosstalk]  	False	True	4
BAKER	Very quickly, Senator.  	False	True	4
BAKER	Please.  	False	True	4
BAKER	...Gentleman, we need to move on...  	False	True	4
BAKER	...We need to move...  	False	True	4
BAKER	...We need too...  	False	True	4
BAKER	...We do need to move on. Mr. Trump...  	False	True	4
BAKER	...Very quick.  	False	True	4
BAKER	Let's talk about — No, no, Governor, I really must move on. I really want to move on.  Mr. Trump, let's talk about the international economy...  	False	True	4
BAKER	...We really need to move on...  	False	True	4
BAKER	...No, governor, I promise I will come to you...  	False	True	4
BAKER	...Listen...  	False	True	4
BAKER	...Mr. Trump, can I ask you about...  	False	True	4
BAKER	...the U.S. just concluded an international trade agreement with 11 countries in the Pacific. You've said that you'd rather have no deal...  	False	True	4
BAKER	...than sign the one that's on the table...  	False	True	4
BAKER	...Most economists — most economists say that trade is boosted growth, and every single post war president has supported the expansion of international trade, including the last three republican presidents. Why would you reverse more than 50 years of U.S. trade policy?  	False	True	4
BAKER	The — the deal, as you say, the terms of the deal were published — were published just last week, the details, 5,000 pages of it, and 80 percent of U.S. trade with countries in the Pacific, these countries, these 11 countries, is actually tariff-free, and these — the trade deal only affects the other 20 percent. Which — are there particular parts of the deal that you think were badly negotiated?  	False	True	4
BAKER	There was a separate — separate...  [crosstalk]  	False	True	4
BAKER	But isn't that — isn't that part of the problem? When I say, Senator, that if — if this deal is not ratified by — by the U.S. — by the Senate, then it would actually give China an opportunity to grow its economic leadership, which it's been seeking to do? And if the U.S. is unable to take part in this trade deal with these countries in Asia, China will take the lead?  	False	True	4
BAKER	Thank you. Thanks, Senator.  	False	True	4
BAKER	Thank you, Senator.  Governor Kasich, I want to ask you about China, in particular hundreds of American companies have been subjected to cyber attacks from the Chinese military, yet state-backed Chinese companies, growing their presence in the United States, Chinese investments in U.S., which were nearly nonexistent a few years ago, are now over $50 billion. And as my newspaper recently reported, Chinese companies are planning to bid for one of the largest hotel chains in the United States, what would be the largest ever Chinese takeover of a U.S. company. Would you stop them?  	False	True	4
BAKER	Thank you, Governor. Plenty of opportunities. Thank you.  Neil?  	False	True	4
BAKER	Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate, live from Milwaukee.  Now let's get straight back to the questions, and Governor Bush.  Governor, Hillary Clinton recently said that if we had another financial crisis like the one in 2008, she wouldn't bail out the banks. Would you?  	False	True	4
BAKER	But, Governor, but can I just quickly — did — you can't seriously guarantee that there won't be another financial crisis, can you?  	False	True	4
BAKER	Ever? There will never be another financial crisis?  	False	True	4
BAKER	Dr. Carson, if I may, just on that point, despite measures taken, as the governor says, since the crisis to make the financial system safer, the major banks in the U.S., many of them are actually bigger than ever. Asset held by JPMorgan Chase, for example, the very largest bank, have increased by nearly 40 percent to over $2.6 trillion. Do you think JPMorgan and the other big banks should be broken up?  	False	True	4
BAKER	But just to be clear, just — just to be clear, then, you wouldn't — you wouldn't favor breaking up the big banks? You think they're big enough — they're OK as they are, as big as they are?  	False	True	4
BAKER	Thank you, Dr. Carson.  	False	True	4
BAKER	Thank you.  	False	True	4
BAKER	Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate. And now, candidates, it's time for your closing statements. You get 30 seconds each, and, Senator Paul, we will begin with you.  	False	True	4
BAKER	Thank you, Senator. Governor Kasich?  	False	True	4
HOLT	Good evening and welcome to the NBC News Youtube Democratic candidate's debate. After all the campaigning, soon, Americans will have their say with the first votes of the 2016 campaign just 15 days away in Iowa. And New Hampshire not far behind.  Tonight will be the final opportunity to see these candidates face to face before the voting begins. Our purpose here tonight is to highlight and examine the differences among the three Democratic candidates. So let's get started.  Please welcome Secretary Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders and Governor Martin O'Malley. [applause]  Well, welcome to all of you. Hope you're excited, we're excited. We want to thank our hosts, the Congressional Black Caucus Institute. I'm joined by my colleague Andrea Mitchell tonight. The rules are simple. Sixty seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups or rebuttals. I know you'll all keep exactly to time, so our job should be pretty easy here tonight. We'll have questions from the Youtube community throughout the debate.  This is a critical point in the race. You've been defining your differences with each other especially vigorously in the last week on the campaign trail. We're here to facilitate this conversation on behalf of the voters so that they know exactly where you stand as you face off tonight. Let's have a great debate.  We'll begin with 45 second opening statements from each candidate, starting with Secretary Clinton.  	True	False	4
HOLT	Thank you. Senator Sanders, your opening statement, sir.  	True	False	4
HOLT	"Senator, thank you. [applause]  And Governor O'Malley, your opening statement, sir.  O'MALLEY: Thank you. My name is Martin O'Malley, I was born the year Dr. King delivered his ""I Have A Dream"" speech.  And I want to thank the people of South Carolina, not only for hosting our debate here tonight, but also for what you taught all of us in the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Mother Emanuel Church.  You taught us, in fact, in keeping with Dr. King's teaching, that love would have the final word when you took down the Confederate flag from your state house; let go of the past and move forward.  Eight years ago, you brought forward a new leader in Barack Obama to save our country from the second Great Depression. And that's what he's done. Our country's doing better, we're creating jobs again.  But in order to make good on the promise of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law, and we have urgent work to do, and the voices of anger and fear and division that we've heard coming off of the Republican presidential podiums are pretty loud.  We need new leadership. We need to come together as a people and build on the good things that President Obama has done.  That's why I'm running for president. I need your help, I ask for your vote, and I look forward to moving our country forward once again.  Thank you.  "	True	False	4
HOLT	All right. And Governor, thank you. [applause]  All right, to our first question, now. The first question, I'll be addressing to all of the candidates.  President Obama came to office determined to swing for the fences on health care reform. Voters want to know how you would define your presidency? How would you think big? So complete this sentence: in my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be — fill in the blank.  Senator Sanders.  	True	False	4
HOLT	Secretary Clinton, same question, my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be.  	True	False	4
HOLT	Governor O'Malley, same question.  O'MALLEY: Thank you. First of all, I would lay out an agenda to make wages go up again for all Americans, rather than down. Equal pay for equal work, making it easier rather than harder for people to join labor unions and bargain collectively for better wages; getting 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, however we can, wherever we can.  Secondly, I believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years is climate change. And I put forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way. [applause]  	True	False	4
HOLT	Thank you. You've all...  O'MALLEY: Finally — I'm sorry, that was second, Lester.  And third and finally, we need a new agenda for America's cities. We have not had a new agenda for America's cities since Jimmy Carter. We need a new agenda for America cities that will invest in the talents and skills in our people, that will invest in CBVG transportation, infrastructure and transit options, and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built clean green energy future that will employ our people.  	True	False	4
HOLT	"All right governor thank you.  We've all laid out large visions and we're going to cover a lot of the ground you talked about as we continue in the evening. The last couple of weeks of this campaign have featured some of the sharpest exchanges in the race. Let's start with one of them, the issue of guns.  Senator Sanders, last week Secretary Clinton called you quote, ""a pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby."" Right before the debate you changed your position on immunity from lawsuits for gun manufacturers, can you tell us why?  "	True	False	4
HOLT	Senator, but you didn't answer the question that you did change your position on immunity from gun manufacturers. So can you...  	True	False	4
HOLT	Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond to Senator Sanders.  	True	False	4
HOLT	"All right, Governor O'Malley, you signed tough gun control measures as governor of Maryland and there are a lot Democrats in the audience here in South Carolina who own guns. This conversation might be worrying many of them. They may be hearing, ""you want to take my guns. What would you say to them?  O'MALLEY: This is what I would say Lester, look see, I've listened to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation and I would have to agree with both of them. They've both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue.  I'm the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation. This is very personal to me being from Baltimore. I will never forget one occasion visiting a little boy in Johns' Hopkins Hospital, he was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boy's head was pierced with a bullet. And I remember visiting him, it did not kill him - I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. He was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery, and that boys head was pierced with a bullet.  And, I remember visiting him, it did not kill him. I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. In his diapers with tubes running in and out of his head, same age as my little boy.  So, after the slaughter of the kids in Connecticut last year, we brought people together. We did pass in our state comprehensive gun safety legislation. It did have a ban on combat assault weapons, universal background checks, and you know what? We did not interrupt a single person's hunting season.  I've never met a self respecting deer hunter that needed an AR-15 to down a deer. And, so...[applause]...we're able to actually do these things.  "	True	False	4
HOLT	Alright, Governor, thank you.  Secretary Clinton, this is a community that has suffered a lot of heartache in the last year. Of course, as you mentioned, the church shootings. We won't forget the video of Walter Scott being shot in the back while running from police.  We understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified, but it plays straight to the fears of many African American men that their lives are cheap. Is that perception, or in your view, is it reality?  	True	False	4
HOLT	You time is up.  Senator Sanders, my next question is...  	True	False	4
HOLT	... It's actually — actually my next question is to you...  	True	False	4
HOLT	Senator Sanders...  	True	False	4
HOLT	Senator. Senator Sanders...  	True	False	4
HOLT	... Just over a week ago the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Secretary Clinton, not you. He said that choosing her over you was not a hard decision. In fact, our polling shows she's beating you more than two to one among minority voters. How can you be the nominee if you don't have that support?  	True	False	4
HOLT	"Governor, I'm going to come to you in a second.  Google searches for the words, ""Black Lives Matter"" surpassed, ""civil rights movement"". And, here in South Carolina, ""black lives matter"" was the number one trending political issue.HOLT: Governor O'Malley, you've campaigned on your record as governor of Maryland, and before that, the mayor of Baltimore. Last year, of course, Baltimore was rocked by violent unrest in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray.  And right from the start of your campaign, you've been dogged by those who blame your tough-on-crime, so-called zero tolerance policies as mayor for contributing to that unrest. What responsibility do you bear?  O'MALLEY: Yes, let's talk about this. When I ran for mayor in 1999, Lester, it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we were burying over 300 young, poor black men every single year.  And that's why I ran, because, yes, black lives matter. And we did a number of things. We weren't able to make our city immune from setbacks as the Freddie Gray unrest and tragic death showed.  But we were able to save a lot of lives doing things that actually worked to improve police and community relations. The truth of the matter is, we created a civilian review board. And many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that I've put forward.  We created a civilian review board, gave them their own detectives. We required the reporting of discourtesy, use of excessive force, lethal force. I repealed the possession of marijuana as a crime in our state.  I drove our incarceration rate down to 20-year lows, and drove violent crime down to 30-year lows, and became the first governor south of the Mason-Dixon line to repeal the death penalty.  I feel a responsibility every day to find things that work... [applause]  "	True	False	4
HOLT	All right. Let's talk...  O'MALLEY: ... and to do more of them to reform our criminal justice system.  	True	False	4
HOLT	Let's talk more about policing and the criminal justice system. Senator Sanders, a few times tonight we're going to hear from some of the most prominent voices on YouTube, starting with Franchesca Ramsey, who tackles racial stereotypes through her videos. Let's watch.  [begin video clip]  FRANCHESCA RAMSEY: Hey, I'm Franchesca Ramsey. I believe there's a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their own communities.  For example, last month, the officers involved in the case of 12- year-old Tamir Rice weren't indicted. How would your presidency ensure that incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?  [end video clip]  	True	False	4
HOLT	Senator Sanders.  	True	False	4
HOLT	Would you like me to read it back to you?  	True	False	4
HOLT	"Prosecutors — ""I believe there's a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their communities. Most recently, we saw this with a non- indictment of the officers involved in the case of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. How would you presidency ensure incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?""  "	True	False	4
HOLT	Secretary Clinton, this question is for you. Tonight parts of America are in the grip of a deadly heroin epidemic, spanning race and class, hitting small towns and cities alike. It has become a major issue in this race.  In a lot of places where you've been campaigning, despite an estimated trillion dollars spent, many say the war on drugs has failed. So what would you do?  	True	False	4
HOLT	And that's time.  	True	False	4
HOLT	Senator...  	True	False	4
HOLT	Senator Sanders, would you like to respond?  	True	False	4
HOLT	That's...  	True	False	4
HOLT	... time.  	True	False	4
HOLT	We're going to get into all that coming up.  O'MALLEY: Lester, just ten seconds.  	True	False	4
HOLT	But we're going to take a break and we need to take a break...  O'MALLEY: Just 10 seconds. All of the things...  	True	False	4
HOLT	... and when we come back, the anger brewing in America.  [commercial break]  	True	False	4
HOLT	Welcome back to Charleston. Let's turn to another area where there has been fierce disagreement — that would be health care.  Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton, you both mentioned it in your 100-day priorities.  Let's turn to my colleague, Andrea Mitchell now to lead that questioning.  	True	False	4
HOLT	And that's time. We're gonna take a turn now.  Secretary Clinton, in his final State of the Union address, President Obama said his biggest regret was his inability to bring the country together. If President Obama couldn't do it, how will you?  O'MALLEY: Great question.  	True	False	4
HOLT	That's time. Senator Sanders, response. [applause]  	True	False	4
HOLT	That's time. But let me continue with the...  	True	False	4
HOLT	Senator Sanders, let me continue, you call yourself a Democratic socialist...  	True	False	4
HOLT	"And throughout your career in politics, you've been critical of the Democratic party, you've been saying in a book you wrote, quote, ""There wasn't a hell of a big difference between the the two major parties."" How would you will a general election...  "	True	False	4
HOLT	How will you win a general election labeling yourself a democratic socialist?  	True	False	4
HOLT	Yes, but senator, you can...  	True	False	4
HOLT	And that is right.  	True	False	4
HOLT	Secretary Clinton, our next question is for you. Here's another quantitative problem.  	True	False	4
HOLT	And we're going to get into that coming up. But Secretary Clinton, here's a question from YouTube. It's from a young video blogger who has over 5 million subscribers. He has a question about the importance of younger voters.  [begin video clip]  	True	False	4
HOLT	Secretary Clinton.  	True	False	4
HOLT	That's time...  	True	False	4
HOLT	A quick follow up — a thirty second follow up.  Why is Senator Sanders beating you to 2 to 1 among younger votes?  	True	False	4
HOLT	We're going to take...  	True	False	4
HOLT	We're going to take a break. When we come back; big banks, big business and big differences among the three candidates on the American Economy. We'll be right back.  [commercial break]  	True	False	4
HOLT	"Welcome back from Charleston. Let's turn now to the economy.  Senator Sanders, you released a tough new ad last week in which without mentioning Secretary Clinton by name, you talk about two Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street. ""One says it's OK to take millions from big banks and tell them what to do. My plan, break up the big banks, close the tax loopholes and make them pay their fair share.""  What do you see as the difference between what you would do about the banks and what Secretary Clinton would do?  "	True	False	4
HOLT	Secretary Clinton, help the voter understand the daylight between the two of you here.  	True	False	4
HOLT	Senator Sanders, your response.  	True	False	4
HOLT	That's time.  Governor O'Malley...[crosstalk]  	True	False	4
HOLT	I have a question for you... [applause]  	True	False	4
HOLT	Thirty-second response.  	True	False	4
HOLT	Governor O'Malley.  O'MALLEY: Yes, thank you. Yes, Lester, what Secretary Clinton just said is actually not true. What — I have put forward a plan that would actually put cops back on the beat of Wall Street. I have put forward a plan that was heralded as very comprehensive and realistic.  Look, if a bank robber robs a bank and all you do is slap him on the wrist, he's just going to keep robbing banks again. The same thing is true with people in suits.  Secretary Clinton, I have a tremendous amount of respect for you, but for you to say there's no daylight on this between the three of us is also not true. I support reinstituting a modern version of Glass- Steagall that would include going after the shadow banks, requiring capital requirements that would force them to no longer put us on the hook for these sorts of things.  In prior debates I've heard you even bring up — I mean, now you bring up President Obama here in South Carolina in defense of the fact of your cozy relationship with Wall Street.  In an earlier debate, I heard you bring up even the 9/11 victims to defend it. The truth of the matter is, Secretary Clinton, you do not go as far as reining in Wall Street as I would.  And the fact of the matter is, the people of America deserve to have a president that's on their side, protecting the main street economy from excesses on Wall Street. And we're just as vulnerable today.  	True	False	4
HOLT	Secretary Clinton, 30-second response. [applause]  	True	False	4
HOLT	That's time.  Andrea.  	True	False	4
HOLT	... Senator...  	True	False	4
HOLT	We have got a lot to ground to cover here.  Many Democratic voters are passionate about the need to do something to combat the threat of climate change, including the team of scientists from Youtube's MinuteEarth channel.  Here's their take.  [begin video clip]  	True	False	4
HOLT	Senator Sanders, Americans love their SUVs, which spiked in sales last year as gas prices plummeted.  How do you convince Americans that the problem of climate change is so urgent that they need to change their behavior?  	True	False	4
HOLT	Governor O'Malley, 30 seconds.  O'MALLEY: Thank you.  Lester, on this stage tonight, this Democratic stage, where we actually believe in science. [laughter]  I would like to challenge and invite my colleagues here on this stage to join me in putting forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean, electric energy grid by 2050. It can be done. [applause]  With solar, with wind, with new technologies, with green buildings, this can happen, but in all — President Obama made us more energy independent, but in all of the above strategy didn't land us on the moon, we need American ingenuity and we need to reach by 2050 for the sake of our kids.  	True	False	4
HOLT	That's time. We're going to take a break.  	True	False	4
HOLT	When we return, the late-breaking developments regarding Iran. The threat of ISIS now more real than ever on U.S. soil. Americans in fear and hearing few good answers.  We'll be right back.  [commercial break]  	True	False	4
HOLT	Charleston, Andrea Mitchell has questions now starting with Iran.  	True	False	4
HOLT	Senator Sanders mentioned Russia a moment ago. Secretary Clinton, you famously handed Russia's foreign minister a reset button in 2009. Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea, fomented a war in Ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations, as we just did discuss, to support Assad in Syria. As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?  	True	False	4
HOLT	What's your relationship with him?  	True	False	4
HOLT	We to want turn right now to the issue of balancing national security concerns with the privacy rights of Americans. That brings us to YouTube and this question.  [begin video clip]  	True	False	4
HOLT	So, Governor O'Malley.  O'MALLEY: Thank you.  I believe whether it's a back door or a front door that the American principle of law should still hold that our federal government should have to get a warrant, whether they want to come through the back door or your front door. [applause]  And I also agree, Lester, with Benjamin Franklin, who said, no people should ever give up their privacy or their freedoms in a promise for security.  So we're a collaborative people. We need collaborative leadership here with Silicon Valley and other bright people in my own state of Maryland and around the NSA that can actually figure this out.  But there are certain immutable principles that will not become antique things in our country so long as we defend our country and its values and its freedoms. And one of those things is our right to be secure in our homes, and our right to expect that our federal government should have to get a warrant.  I also want to the say that while we've made some progress on the Patriot Act, I do believe that we need an adversarial court system there. We need a public advocate. We need to develop jurisprudence so that we can develop a body of law that protects the privacy of Americans in the information and digital age.  	True	False	4
HOLT	That's time.  You have all talked about what you would do fighting ISIS over there, but we've been hit in this country by home-grown terrorists, from Chattanooga to San Bernardino, the recent shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia. How are you going to fight the lone wolves here, Senator Sanders?  O'MALLEY: Yes, Lester, year in and year out I was the leader of the U.S. ...  	True	False	4
HOLT	That's a question to Senator Sanders. I wasn't clear, I apologize.  	True	False	4
HOLT	But in terms of lone wolves, the threat, how would you do it?  	True	False	4
HOLT	We have to go to a — we have to go to a break, and when we come back, we're going to get to some of the burning questions these candidates have yet to answer and are totally eager to talk about.  	True	False	4
HOLT	And welcome back to Charleston.  As we were going to a break, Secretary Clinton, I cut you off. I'll give you 30 seconds to respond on the issue of lone wolves.  O'MALLEY: Can I get 30 seconds, too? [laughter]  	True	False	4
HOLT	Secretary Clinton.  	True	False	4
HOLT	And Andrea has a follow-up.  O'MALLEY: And Andrea — Andrea — Andrea...  	True	False	4
HOLT	All right, that's time, and — and we do...[applause]...we do have to move on.  Secretary Clinton, this is the first time...  	True	False	4
HOLT	Thirty — 30 — 30 seconds, Senator.  	True	False	4
HOLT	All right. Secretary Clinton...[applause]...this is the first time that a spouse of a former president could be elected president. You have said that President Clinton would advise you on economic issues, but be specific, if you can. Are you talking about a kitchen-table role on economics, or will he have a real policy role?  	True	False	4
HOLT	Senator sanders, a 30 second response, sir. [applause]  	True	False	4
HOLT	We will take a break. We'll continue from Charleston right after this.  [commercial break]  	True	False	4
HOLT	Welcome back everybody. Finally, before we go tonight, we set out here to understand points of differences between you. We believe we've learned a lot here, but before we leave, is there anything that you really wanted to say tonight that you haven't gotten a chance to say.  And, we'll start with Governor O'Malley. [laughter]  Didn't see that coming, did you?  O'MALLEY: Yes, but we're going to have to get 20 minutes to do it, so. [laughter]  	True	False	4
HOLT	Sixty seconds, we'd appreciate it.  O'MALLEY: There are so many issues that we haven't been able to discuss here. We have not fully discussed immigration reform, and the deplorable number of immigrant detention camps that our nation's now maintaining. We haven't discussed the shameful treatment that the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow Americans, are getting treated with by these hedge funds that are working them over. [applause]  We haven't discussed the fact that in our hemisphere we have the danger of nation-state failures because of drug traffickers; and Honduras, and Guatemala and El Salvador.  I guess the bottom line is this, look we are a great people the way we act at home and abroad based on the beliefs that unite us. Our belief in the dignity of every person, our belief in our own common good. There is now challenge that is too great for us to overcome provided we bring forward in these divided times, new leadership that can heal our divides here at home and bring our principles into alignment abroad.  We're on the threshold of a new era of American progress and I believe we have only need to join forces together and cross that threshold into a new era of American prosperity.  	True	False	4
HOLT	And that's time.  O'MALLEY: Thanks a lot.  	True	False	4
HOLT	Secretary Clinton?  	True	False	4
HOLT	And that's time.  	True	False	4
HOLT	Thank you.  Senator Sanders?  	True	False	4
HOLT	All right. Well thank you and thanks to all of you for being here tonight shedding light on some of the differences as Americans get ready to vote.  I also want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and certainly my friend and colleague, Andrea Mitchell. This has been great. It's been a great spirited conversation and American people appreciate it.	True	False	4
CHAFEE	Thank you, Anderson.  Thank you, CNN, and thank you Facebook for organizing this debate.  Not only will Americans be electing a new president next year, we also will be electing a world leader. Voters should assess the candidate's experience, character and vision for the future as they make this important decision.  I'm the only one running for president that has been a mayor, a United States senator, and a governor. As mayor, I brought labor peace to my city and kept taxes down. I was reelected three times. As a senator, I earned a reputation for courageous votes against the Bush-Cheney tax cuts the favored the wealthy, against the tragedy of the Iraq war, for environmental stewardship, for protection of our civil liberties. I served on the Foreign Relations Committee and I chaired the Middle East Subcommittee for four years.  As governor, I came in at the depths of the recession and we turned my state around. Rhode Island had the biggest drop of the unemployment rate over my four budgets of all but one state. It happens to be Nevada, where we're having this debate. I'm very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals. I've always been honest. I have the courage to take the long-term view, and I've shown good judgment. I have high ethical standards.  As we look to the future, I want to address the income inequality, close the gap between the haves and the have-nots. I want to address climate change, a real threat to our planet. And I believe in prosperity through peace. I want to end these wars.  I look forward to the discussion ahead.  Thank you [applause]  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	Anderson, you're looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues. Whether it's...  [crosstalk]  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	Did you hear what I said? On the issues. I have not changed on the issues. I was a liberal Republican, then I was an independent, and now I'm a proud Democrat. But I have not changed on the issues.  And I open my record to scrutiny. Whether it's on the environment, a woman's right to choose, gay marriage, fiscal responsibility, aversion to foreign entanglements, using the tools of government to help the less fortunate.  Time and time again, I have never changed. You're looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues. So I have not changed.  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	The party left me. There's no doubt about that. There was no room for a liberal moderate Republican in that party. I even had a primary for my reelection in 2006. I won it. But the money poured in to defeat me in Rhode Island as a Republican. That's what we were up against.  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	Yes, I have a good record of voting for gun commonsense safety legislation, but the reality is, despite these tragedies that happen time and time again, when legislators step up to pass commonsense gun safety legislation, the gun lobby moves in and tells the people they're coming to take away your guns.  And, they're successful at it, in Colorado and others states, the legislators that vote for commonsense gun safety measures then get defeated. I even saw in Rhode Island. So, I would bring the gun lobby in and say we've got to change this. Where can we find common ground? Wayne Lapierre from the NRA, whoever it is, the leaders. Come one, we've go to change this. We're not coming to take away your guns, we believe in the Second Amendment, but let's find common ground here.  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	Well, we just heard Senator Sanders say that it's the worst decision in American history. That's very significant, the worst decision in American history, I just heard from Senator Sanders.  So, as we look ahead, if you're going to make those poor judgment calls, a critical time in our history, we just finished with the Vietnam era, getting back into another quagmire — if you're looking ahead, and you're looking at someone who made that poor decision in 2002 to go into Iraq when there was no real evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq — I know because I did my homework, and, so, that's an indication of how someone will perform in the future. And that's what's important. [applause]  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	OK. I just have to answer one thing that Senator Webb said about the Iran deal, because I'm a strong proponent of what President Obama — and he said that because of that the Iran deal that enabled Russia to come in.  No, that's not true, Senator Webb. I respect your foreign policy chops. But Russia is aligned with Iran and with Assad and the Alawite Shias in Syria. So that Iran deal did not allow Russia to come in.  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	It's certainly the chaos in the Middle East. There's no doubt about it.  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	And it all started with the Iraq invasion.  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	Absolutely. We have to repair American credibility after we told the world that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which he didn't. So there's an issue of American credibility out there. So any time someone is running to be our leader, and a world leader, which the American president is, credibility is an issue out there with the world. And we have repair work to be done. I think we need someone that has the best in ethical standards as our next president. That's how I feel.  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	The Glass-Steagall was my very first vote, I'd just arrived, my dad had died in office, I was appointed to the office, it was my very first vote.  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	I'd just arrived at the Senate. I think we'd get some takeovers, and that was one. It was my very first vote, and it was 92-5. It was the...  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	But let me just say...  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	I think you're being a little rough. I'd just arrived at the United States Senate. I'd been mayor of my city. My dad had died. I'd been appointed by the governor. It was the first vote and it was 90-5, because it was a conference report.  But let me just say about income inequality. We've had a lot of talk over the last few minutes, hours, or tens of minutes, but no one is saying how we're going to fix it. And it all started with the Bush tax cuts that favored the wealthy.  So let's go back to the tax code. And 0.6 percent of Americans are at the top echelon, over 464,000, 0.6 Americans. That's less than 1 percent. But they generate 30 percent of the revenue. And they're doing fine.  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	So there's still a lot more money to be had from this top echelon. I'm saying let's have another tier and put that back into the tax bracket. And that will generate $42 billion.  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	And then we can help the middle class and hard-earning Americans — hard-working Americans.  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	No, that was another 99 to one vote for the Patriot Act, and it was seen as at the time modernizing our ability to do what we've always done to tap phones which always required a warrant. And I voted for that.  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	No, no. As long as you're getting a warrant, I believe that under the Fourth Amendment, you should be able to do surveillance, but you need a warrant. That's what the Fourth Amendment says. And in the Patriot Act, section 215 started to get broadened too far. So I would be in favor of addressing and reforming section 215 of the Patriot Act.  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	No, I would bring him home. The courts have ruled that what he did — what he did was say the American...  [crosstalk]  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	... the American government was acting illegally. That's what the federal courts have said; what Snowden did showed that the American government was acting illegally for the Fourth Amendment. So I would bring him home.  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	Certainly, ending the wars. We've got to stop these wars. You have to have a new dynamic, a new paradigm. We just spent a half-billion dollars arming and training soldiers, the rebel soldiers in Syria. They quickly join the other side. We bombed the...  [crosstalk]  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	I'd like to finish my question — my answer.  And also we just bombed a hospital. We've had drone strikes that hit civilian weddings. So I would change how we — our approach to the Middle East. We need a new paradigm in the Middle East.  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	I guess the coal lobby. I've worked hard for climate change and I want to work with the coal lobby. But in my time in the Senate, tried to bring them to the table so that we could address carbon dioxide. I'm proud to be at odds with the coal lobby.  	True	False	1
CHAFEE	Thank you, Anderson. Thank you, CNN. And thank you, Facebook, for sponsoring this debate.  America has many challenges confronting us — ending the perpetual wars, addressing climate change, addressing income inequality, funding education, funding infrastructure, funding healthcare, helping black Americans, helping Native Americans. We have many challenges. Who is best able to confront these challenges?  I've served in government at many levels. I know what it's like to solve problems at the local level because I did it as mayor. I know how to get legislation passed through Congress because I did it as a senator. I know how to turn around a state because I did as governor of Rhode Island.  But what I'm most proud of is that in 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals. I have high ethical standards. And what I'm most proud of is my judgment, particularly in the Iraq war vote. There was a lot of pressure — political pressure, public pressure. But I did my homework and I did not believe that the evidence was there that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. And we live now with the consequences.  So that kind of judgment is what we want in a president going forward. And I'm running for president to end the wars. I want to be the peacemaker. I am a proven peacemaker. Please go to Chafee 2016 to learn more about me. Thank you. [applause]  	True	False	1
BARTIROMO	Tonight we are working with Facebook to ask the candidates the questions voters want answered. And according to Facebook, the U.S. election has dominated the global conversation, with 131 million people talking about the 2016 race. That makes it the number one issue talked about on Facebook last year worldwide.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	"Tonight's rules are simple: up to 90 seconds for each answer, one minute for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over the allotted time, you'll hear this. [bell rings] So let's get started. Candidates, jobs and growth — two of the biggest issues facing the country right now. In his State of the Union address earlier this week, the president said, quote, ""we have the strongest, most durable economy in the world.""  And according to our Facebook research, jobs is one of the biggest issues resonating across the country, including here in South Carolina. The president is touting 14 million new jobs and an unemployment rate cut in half.  The president said that anyone who claims America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction. Senator Cruz, what do you see that he doesn't?  "	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir. [applause]  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	We know that recent global events have many people worried — Iran detaining American sailors, forcing them to apologize; North Korea and its nuclear ambitions; an aggressive China; and a Middle East that continues to deteriorate, not to mention ISIS is getting stronger.  Governor Christie, sometimes it seems the world is on fire. Where and when should a president use military action to restore order?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Just to be clear Governor, where and when would you use military action?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Dr. Carson, the president says he does not want to treat ISIS as a foreign army, but ISIS is neither a country nor a government. How do you attack a network that does not respect national borders?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	"Senator Cruz, the New York Times is reporting that you failed to properly disclose a million dollars in loans from Goldman Sachs and CitiBank. During your senate race, your campaign said, ""it was inadvertent."" A million dollars is inadvertent?  "	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you.  [commercial break]  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	"Thank you, senator.  Mr. Trump, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in her response to the State of the Union address...[applause]...appeared to choose sides within the party, saying Republicans should resist, quote, ""the siren call of the angriest voices"". She confirmed, she was referring to you among others. Was she out of line? And, how would a President Trump unite the party?  "	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	But what are you going to do about it?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Governor Kasich...[applause]... Governor Kasich, Hillary Clinton is getting some serious competition from Senator Bernie Sanders. He's now at 41 percent in the latest CBS/New York Times poll. Vice President Biden sang his praises, saying Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real, and he has credibility on it.  So what does it say about our country that a candidate who is a self-avowed socialist and who doesn't think a 90 percent tax rate is too high could be the Democratic nominee?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Dr. Carson, one of the other candidates on this stage has brought Bill Clinton's past indiscretions. Is that a legitimate topic in this election? And what do you think of the notion that Hillary Clinton is an enabler of sexual misconduct?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Welcome back to the Republican presidential debates, right here in North Charleston. Let's get right back to the questions.  Governor Bush, gun rights, one of the top issues seen on Facebook with close to 3 million people talking about it in the past month. Right here in Charleston, Dylann Roof, who has been accused of killing nine people in a nearby church, reportedly had not passed his background check when he got his gun. What is the harm in tightening standards for not only who buys guns, but those who sell them?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir.  Mr. Trump, are there any circumstances that you think we should be limiting gun sales of any kind in America?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you sir.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir. [applause]  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	So what is the answer, Senator Cruz, to stop mass shootings and violent crime, up in 30 cities across the country?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	"Senator...[applause]... let me follow up and switch gears. Senator Cruz, you suggested Mr. Trump, quote, ""embodies New York values."" Could you explain what you mean by that?  "	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	I am from New York. I don't.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Are you sure about that?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	There's much more ahead including the fight against ISIS. More from Charleston, South Carolina when we come right back.  [commercial break]  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	"We welcome back to the Republican Presidential , right back to the questions.  Candidates, the man who made fighting ISIS the cornerstone of his campaign, South Carolina Senator, Lindsey Graham is out the race but he joins us tonight in the audience. [applause]  He says, ""the air-strike now in their 16th month have been ineffective."" Dr. Carson ...  "	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	The air-strikes.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Now in their 16th month are ineffective. Dr. Carson, do you think Senator Graham is right in wanting to send 20,000 troops — ground troops to Iraq and Syria to take out ISIS?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	"Thank you, sir. Senator Graham has also said that the U.S. will find Arab support for its coalition if it removes Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. And I quote, ""The now king of Saudi Arabia told us, 'you can have our army, you just got to deal with Assad.'  ""The emir of Qatar said, 'I'll pay for the operation, but they are not going to fight ISIS and let Damascus fall into the hands of the Iranians. Assad has to go.'""  Governor Christie, how important is it to remove Assad from power and how would you do it?  "	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir. [applause]  Mr. Trump — Mr. Trump, your comments about banning Muslims from entering the country created a firestorm. According to Facebook, it was the most-talked-about moment online of your entire campaign, with more than 10 million people talking about the issue.  Is there anything you've heard that makes you want to rethink this position?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	We — we want to hear from all of you on this. According to Pew Research, the U.S. admits more than 100,000 Muslim immigrants every single year on a permanent lifetime basis. I want to ask the rest of you to comment on this. Do you agree that we should pause Muslim immigration until we get a better handle on our homeland security situation, as Mr. Trump has said?  Beginning with you, Governor Kasich.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir, we want to hear from the rest of you,  Governor Christie, your take.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Senator Rubio, where do you stand?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Senator Cruz, where do you stand? Senator Cruz?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Dr. Carson, where do you stand? Do you agree with Mr. Trump?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	So, to be clear, the both of you do not agree with Mr. Trump?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you governor.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	We're getting...  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Prices go higher for...  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Yeah.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Real quick, Senator — go ahead, Senator Cruz. [applause]  And then we have to get to tax reform.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you, Governor Bush. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Very briefly.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you, Mr. Trump.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you, Mr. Trmup. Thank you, Governor.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Senator briefly.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	We've got to get to tax reform, gentlemen. We've got to get to tax reform, and we've got to get to the...  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	... we've got to get to the national debt as well. Coming up next, the growing national debt, the war on crime, tax reform. More from North Charleston, South Carolina, when we come right back.  [commercial break]  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Welcome back to the Republican presidential here in North Charleston. Right back to the questions. [applause]  Governor Christie, we have spoken much about cutting spending, given the $19 trillion debt. But according to one report, America needs $3.6 trillion in infrastructure spending by 2020.  Here in South Carolina, 11 percent of bridges are considered structurally deficient, costing drivers a billion dollars a year in auto repairs. What is your plan to fix the ailing roads and bridges without breaking the bank?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir. Dr. Carson...[applause]...it is true U.S. companies have $2 trillion in cash sitting overseas right now. That could be used for investment and jobs in America.  Also, several companies right now are pursuing mergers to move their corporate headquarters abroad, and take advantage of much lower taxes. What will you do to stop the flow of companies building cash away from America, and those leaving America altogether?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir.  Senator Rubio...  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Which is why we raised it.  Senator Rubio?  Thank you, Mr. Trump.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	One of the biggest fiscal challenges is our entitlement programs, particularly Social Security and Medicare. What policies will you put forward to make sure these programs are more financially secure?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you senator.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Senator Cruz, yes. You were meant to. Yes, of course.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you senator. [applause]  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you senator. I have to get to a question for Mr. Trump.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Yes.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor. [applause]  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you, Dr. Carson.  Coming up, how would the candidates protect America, and another terror attack, if we were to see it. But first, you can join us live on stage during the commercial break right from home. Go to facebook.com/foxbusiness. We'll be streaming live and answering your questions during this break next.  More from South Carolina coming up. Stay with us.  [commercial break]  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Mr. Trump, your net worth is in the multi-billions of dollars and have an ongoing thriving hotel and real estate business. Are you planning on putting your assets in a blind trust should you become president? With such vast wealth, how difficult will it be for you to disentangle yourself from your business and your money and prioritize America's interest first?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	So you'll put your assets in a blind trust?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you sir.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Senator Rubio? [applause]  Under current law, the U.S. is on track to issue more new permanent immigrants on green cards over the next five years than the entire population of South Carolina. The CBO says your 2013 immigration bill would have increased green cardholders by another 10 million over 10 years.  Why are you so interested in opening up borders to foreigners when American workers have a hard enough time finding work?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	So your thinking has changed?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you, Senator. [applause]  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Thank you, Senator.  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	When we come right back, closing statements. Stay with us.  [commercial break]  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Welcome back.  Candidates, it is time for your closing statements. You get 60 seconds each.  Governor John Kasich, we begin with you.  	False	True	6

BARTIROMO	Mr. Donald Trump?  	False	True	6
BARTIROMO	Candidates, thank you.  	False	True	6
HUCKABEE	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.  (LAUGHTER)  But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.  If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules. I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid. Play by the rules.  And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	"Well, I would really appreciate that. First of all, yes, we've stolen. Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.  But, you know what we're not telling them? It's their money. This isn't the governments money. This is not entitlement, it's not welfare. This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks. Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it. Now, we're going to blame the people.  Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money. That makes no sense to everybody. And, they're always going to say, ""Well, we're going to fix this one day.""  No their not. It's like a 400 pound man saying, ""I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do.""  And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this. But, let me tell you who not to blame. Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security. Let's quit making it a problem for them. It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more. You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...

HUCKABEE	...No, sir...  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	...we need to honor our promises...  (CROSSTALK)  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	...before I go. This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality. If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep? And, the fact is, none of them.  (CROSSTALK)  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	And, the only way -- no...  (CROSSTALK)  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	...Chris...  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	...Chris...  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income. And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means. If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it. If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in. I just want to remind you, people paid their money. They expect to have it. And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.  (APPLAUSE)  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something. In fact, that's part of the problem. If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.  I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.  That is our government today. We saw it in the blimp.  (APPLAUSE)  That's exactly what we saw. So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility. When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.  And it's not the folks on Wall Street. I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	...is paid -- played fairly.  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	Let me just close it out this way.  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	"We need to be focusing on what fixes this country. And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.  Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, ""let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...  "	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	"...""diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?""  "	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that. Thank you. QUICK: Governor, thank you. Appreciate it.  John?  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time. I love Donald Trump. He is a good man. I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight. Get over that one, OK?  (APPLAUSE)  (CROSSTALK)  (UNKNOWN): Is it made in Mexico? HUCKABEE: I don't know.  (UNKNOWN): Where's it made? Is it made in China?  (UNKNOWN): Is it made in China or Mexico?  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	I have no idea.  (CROSSTALK)  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	"You're welcome.  (LAUGHTER)  Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary. I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.  (APPLAUSE)  You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year? I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an ""only guy"" -- ""I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."" Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years. And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.  Somebody says ""I'm a fighter."" Well, I want to know, did you win? Well, I did. And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that. And I think that ought to be worth something.  "	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease. The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this. And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease. We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.  And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it. You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America? We didn't spend any. We've saved billions of dollars.  You want to fix Medicare? Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars. Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.  	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	"You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players. And, we come out here, and we do our thing. And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.  I've got five grandkids. I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, ""Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt. Good luck making something out of this mess.""  And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves. We honest to god are here to get this country back on track. I know this, I certainly am.  "	False	True	3
HUCKABEE	...Thank you.  	False	True	3
CRUZ	Well, you know, David, the assessment the voters are making here in New Hampshire and across the country is they are evaluating each and every one of us. They are looking to our experience. They are looking to our knowledge. They are looking to our temperament and judgment. They are looking to our clarity of vision and our strength of resolve.  The world is getting much more dangerous. We've had seven years with Barack Obama in the oval office, a commander-in-chief that is unwilling even to acknowledge the enemy we're facing. This is a president who, in the wake of Paris, in the wake of San Bernardino, will not even use the words radical Islamic terrorism, much less focus on defeating the enemy.  I am convinced every individual standing on this stage, would make a much better commander-in-chief than Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. [applause]  And the primary voters are making the assessment for each of us, who is best prepared to keep this country safe, to rebuild the military, to rebuild our Navy, our Air Force, our Army, our Marines, and to ensure that we keep America safe.  	False	True	8
CRUZ	"I think that is an assessment the voters are going to make. And they are going to make it of each and everyone of us. They are going to assess who is level-headed, who has clear vision, who has judgment, who can confront our enemies, who can confront the threats we face in this country, and who can have the judgment when to engage and when not to engage — both are incredibly important for a commander-in-chief, knowing how to go after our enemies.  In the case of Iran, for example, who has the clarity of vision to understand that the Ayatollah Khamenei, when he chants, ""Death to America,"" he means it. We need a president with the judgment and resolve to keep this country safe from radical Islamic terrorists.  "	False	True	8
CRUZ	"Ben is a good and honorable man and Ben and Candy have become friends. He has an amazing life story that has inspired millions, including me. When this transpired, I apologized to him then and I do so now. Ben, I'm sorry.  Let me tell you the facts of what occurred for those who are interested in knowing. On Monday night, about 6:30 p.m., CNN reported that Ben was not going from Iowa to New Hampshire or South Carolina. Rather, he was, quote, ""Taking a break from campaigning.""  They reported that on television, CNN's political anchors, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash and Wolf Blitzer, said it was highly unusual and highly significant. My political team saw CNN's report breaking news and they forwarded that news to our volunteers, it was being covered on live television.  Now, at the time, I was at the caucuses, I was getting ready to speak at the caucuses just like Ben was, just like everyone else was. I knew nothing about this. A couple hours later, I found out about it. I was told that Ben was unhappy. I called him that evening because I respect him very, very highly. I didn't reach him that evening.  [bell rings]  I reached him the next day and apologized. He asked me then, he said, Ted, would you make this apologize in public? I said, yes, I will. And I did so. I regret that subsequently, CNN reported on that — they didn't correct that story until 9:15 that night. So from 6:30 p.m. to 9:15, that's what CNN was reporting.  Subsequent to that initial report, Ben's campaign put out a statement saying that he was not suspending his campaign. I wish that our campaign staff had forwarded that statement. They were unaware of it, I wish that they had, that's why I apologized.  "	False	True	8
CRUZ	Well, I would note, initially the fact that we're seeing the launch, and we're seeing the launch from a nuclear North Korea is the direct result of the failures of the first Clinton administration. The Clinton administration led the world in relaxing sanctions against North Korea. Billions of dollars flowed into North Korea in exchange for promises not to build nuclear weapons. They took those billions and built nuclear weapons.  And, I would note also the lead negotiator in that failed North Korea sanctions deal was a woman named Wendy Sherman who Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton promptly recruited to come back to be the lead negotiator with Iran. So, what we are seeing with North Korea is foreshadowing of where we will be with Iran.  With respect to North Korea and what we should do now, one of the first things we should do is expand our missile defense capacity. We ought to put missile defense interceptors in South Korea. South Korea wants them. One of the real risks of this launch, North Korea wants to launch a satellite, and one of the greatest risks of the satellite is they would place a nuclear device in the satellite. As it would orbit around the Earth, and as it got over the United States they would detonate that nuclear weapon and set of what's called an EMP, and electromagnetic pulse which could take down the entire electrical grid on the Eastern seaboard, potentially killing millions.  We need to harden the grid to defend ourselves, and we need missile defense to protect ourselves against North Korea.  	False	True	8
CRUZ	You know, at this point I'm not going to speculate on that without the intelligence briefing that any Commander in Chief would have, knowing what exactly is there. [applause]  One of the real problems...  	False	True	8
CRUZ	... Actually, with respect, I have gotten the intelligence briefings on the Mid-East. Those have been going on for many years. I haven't gotten the intelligence briefing tonight on what North Korea's doing because I'm here in new Hampshire. When you're responding to an immediate incident, you need to know the intelligence of what's occurring.  But what I was saying — look, it is qualitatively different dealing with a country once they have nuclear weapons. It's why you prevent them from getting nuclear weapons in the first place — because your hands are somewhat tied once they have nukes.  It's why this Iranian nuclear deal is so catastrophic, and it's why I've pledged, on the very first day in office, to rip to shreds this Iranian nuclear deal so we're not sitting here in five years, wondering what to do about an Iranian missile launch when they have nuclear weapons. The stakes are too high for that.  	False	True	8
CRUZ	So, in terms of a practical solution, I've laid out the most detailed plan for solving illegal immigration. It's 11 pages, single-spaced, chapter and verse. It's on our website, tedcruz.org.  In short, we're going to do, we're going to build a wall. We're going to triple the border patrol. We're going to increase — and actually, since Donald enjoyed that, I will simply say, I've got somebody in mind to build it.  We're going to increase four-fold, the fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, so that you have technology monitoring an attempted incursion to direct the boots on the ground where they're occurring. We're going to put in place a strong e-verify system in the workplace, so you can't get a job without proving you are here legally.  We'll put in place a biometric exit-entry system on visas, because 40 percent of illegal immigration comes not over the border illegally, but people coming on visas and overstaying.  We will end sanctuary cities by cutting off taxpayer dollars to any jurisdiction that defies federal immigration law. [applause] And we will end welfare benefits for those here illegally. [applause]  	False	True	8
CRUZ	"What you do is, you enforce the law. You know, under the Constitution, the president has an obligation to, quote, ""Take care that the laws be faithfully executed."" Federal immigration law provides, if someone is here illegally and is apprehended, they are to be deported.  We saw just this past week the head of the border patrol union testify before Congress that President Obama had given the order to the border patrol to stand down, not to enforce the law. That is wrong. I will enforce the law, and for everyone who says, you can't possibly do that, I would note that in eight years, Bill Clinton deported 12 million people.  In eight years, George W. Bush deported 10 million people. Enforcing the law — we can do it. What is missing is the political will. And when they were deporting the people, the border wasn't secure, so they'd come right back. Once you secure the border, enforcing the law will solve this problem and that will benefit American workers.  "	False	True	8
CRUZ	Good evening.  	False	True	8
CRUZ	Well, let me take two different parts of that. Let me start with socialized medicine. Socialized medicine is a disaster. It does not work. If you look at the countries that have imposed socialized medicine, that have put the government in charge of providing medicine, what inevitably happens is rationing.  You have a scarcity of doctors. You have rationing. And that means the elderly are told, we're going to ration a hip replacement, we're going to ration a knee replacement. We're going to ration end- of-life care.  We're right now heading into a medical system with about a 90,000-doctor shortage in America and socialized medicine; whether proposed by the Democrats or proposed by a Republican would hurt the people of this country.  What should we do on health care? If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. [applause]  And once we do that, we will adopt common sense reforms, number one, we'll allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines that will drive down prices and expand the availability of low cost catastrophic insurance.  We'll expand health savings accounts; and we will de-link health insurance from employment so that you don't lose your health insurance when you lose your job, and that way health insurance can be personal, portable and affordable and we keep government from getting in between us and our doctors. [applause]  	False	True	8
CRUZ	Well, sure. It starts with a commander-in-chief that sets the objective. And the objective has to be utterly and completely destroying ISIS. Obama hasn't started with that objective and everything else flows from there.  Once you set that objective, we have the tools to carry that out. The first tool is overwhelming air power. It is one of the blessings of the United States of America, having the greatest military on the face of the earth, is we have the ability to use that air power.  As you know, in the first Persian Gulf War, it was 1,100 air attacks a day. Obama is launching between 15 and 30. Now, when I say saturation carpet bombing, that is not indiscriminate.  That is targeted at oil facilities. It's targeted at the oil tankers. It's targeted at command and control locations. It's targeted at infrastructure. It's targeted at communications. It's targeted at bombing all of the roads and bridges going in and out of Raqqa. It's using overwhelming air power.  You know, couple of weeks ago, it was reported that a facility is open called Jihadist University. Now, the question I wonder, why is that building still standing? It should be rubble. And if you had a president...[bell rings] [applause]... all though I will say this. I would be willing to wait until freshman orientation before launching those bombs.  	False	True	8
CRUZ	Martha, I will tell you, I have visited with active duty military, with veterans over and over and over again in town halls all over the state of New Hampshire. What we are doing to our sons and daughters, it is immoral. We are sending them into fight with their arms tied behind their back. They cannot defend themselves. And it is wrong. [applause]  And I will tell you this. Look. America has always been reluctant to use military force. It's the last step we take. But if and when we use it when it comes to defeating ISIS, we should use it. We should use overwhelming force, kill the enemy and then get the heck out. Don't engage in nation-building but instead, allow our soldiers to do their jobs instead of risking their lives with politicians making it impossible to accomplish the objective. [applause]  	False	True	8
CRUZ	Absolutely, yes.  	False	True	8
CRUZ	Well, under the definition of torture, no, it's not. Under the law, torture is excruciating pain that is equivalent to losing organs and systems, so under the definition of torture, it is not. It is enhanced interrogation, it is vigorous interrogation, but it does not meet the generally recognized definition of torture.  	False	True	8
CRUZ	I would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use. And indeed, I joined with Senator McCain in legislation that would prohibit line officers from employing it because I think bad things happen when enhanced interrogation is employed at lower levels.  But when it comes to keeping this country safe, the commander in chief has inherent constitutional authority to keep this country safe. And so, if it were necessary to, say, prevent a city from facing an imminent terrorist attack, you can rest assured that as commander in chief, I would use whatever enhanced interrogation methods we could to keep this country safe.  	False	True	8
CRUZ	Well, thank you for that question. You know, there are three avenues of presidential authority to change the direction of this country. The first is executive power, the second is foreign policy, and the third is legislation. Executive power, as we all know, has been the preferred vehicle of President Obama, abusing his authority, abusing his constitutional authority.  Now, the silver lining of that is everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, so I have pledged on day one I will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action Barack Obama has done. That means on day one his efforts to restrict the Second Amendment go away with the strike of a pen. That means on day one his illegal executive amnesty goes away with the strike of a pen.  The reason I can end Common Core at the federal level is because Obama is abusing executive power using Race to the Top funds in the Department of Education to force it on the states. That's one avenue.  The second avenue of change is foreign policy, and foreign policy can change the fastest. It's worth remembering that Iran released our hostages the day Reagan...[bell rings]...was sworn in. And, the third is legislation, and that can only be done with the people behind you, which is why the two big legislative initiatives I'm campaigning on are repealing Obamacare, and adopting a simple flat tax to abolish the IRS. [applause]  	False	True	8
CRUZ	Well, Josh, as you noted, this is a problem that, for me, I understand first-hand. My older sister, Myriam, who was my half- sister, struggled her whole life with drug and alcohol addiction. My father and her mom divorced when she was a little girl and she was angry her whole life, and she ended up marrying a man who had been in and out of jail. She then became a single mom and she herself went to jail several times and she ended up spending some time in a crack house.  I still remember my father and me driving up to get Myriam out of that crack house to try to convince her she needed to be a mom to — to my nephew Joey.  She wasn't willing to listen. She was not willing to change the path she was on. She was angry. I was — had just gotten my first job coming out of law school. I took a $20,000 loan on a credit card to put my nephew, Joey, in Valley Forge Military Academy — he was in sixth grade at the time, to pay his way through that.  And about five, six years ago, Miriam died of an overdose. It was — the coroner ruled it accidental. We don't know. She went to one night, had taken too many pills, and Joey walked in and found her dead.  This is an absolute epidemic. We need leadership to solve it. Solving it has to occur at the state and local level with programs like A.A., and counseling, and churches and charities. But it also has to be securing the borders, because you have got Mexican cartels that are smuggling vast amounts of heroin into this country.  We know how to secure the borders. What is missing is the political will to do it.  And as president, I will secure the border, we will end this deluge of drugs that is flowing over our southern border and that is killing Americans across this country.  	False	True	8
CRUZ	Well, look, I recognize it is an agonizing experience when anyone is facing a loved — loved member who's been kidnapped. But at the same time, putting in place legal regimes that encourage the payment of ransom has the effect of putting a bounty on other Americans. There is a reason it has been longstanding U.S. policy that we don't negotiate with terrorists, we don't pay ransoms.  If you look at what President Obama has done over and over again, whether it was the James Bergdahl deal, which was absolutely shameful, releasing five senior Taliban terrorists to bring Bergdahl back, or whether it was this recent deal with Iran, where, again, up to 21 terrorists or potential terrorists were — were released or not prosecuted in order to bring back four Americans, what that does — does is it effectively puts a bounty on American servicemen and women serving abroad, on American tourists traveling abroad.  And the proper approach...[bell rings]...is a president and commander in chief that defends this country and that goes after — goes after the terrorists, rather than showing them weakness and encouraging them to target more Americans.  	False	True	8
CRUZ	With an eye to February 20th, Carolina.  	False	True	8
CRUZ	You know, every candidate running for president says they will stand up to Washington. The natural follow up question is when have you ever stood up to Washington.  Last week we saw a powerful illustration of that. I campaigned in the state of Iowa four-square against the ethanol mandate, something everyone said was political suicide. My two leading competitors both attacked me for it. The governor of the state said vote for anyone but Cruz, and lobbyists spent millions of dollars in attack ads, but I stood and said we should have no mandates, a level playing field, and the people of Iowa put country and our children above the cronyism and corporate welfare...[bell rings]... We can turn this country around if we get back to the Constitution. And, I will always stand with the American people against the bipartisan corruption of Washington. [applause]  	False	True	8
OBRADOVICH	Senator Sanders, you've actually talked about immigration as being a wage issue in the United States. And I want to actually go directly to the wage issue now.  You called for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour everywhere in the country. But the President's former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Alan Krueger, has said a national increase of $15 could lead to undesirable and unintended consequences of job loss.  What level of job loss would you consider unacceptable?  	True	False	2
OBRADOVICH	You said there are consequences... [applause]  You said there are consequences for -- for any policy. Do you think job losses are a consequence that are...  	True	False	2
OBRADOVICH	You're calling for a $15 an hour wage now but why did you stop at $10.10 in your state?  O'MALLEY: $10.10 was all I could get the state to do by the time I left in my last year. But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works.  The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows. That's American capitalism.  	True	False	2
OBRADOVICH	Yes, Senator Sanders, you famously said in the last debate that you were sick and tired of hearing about your damn e- mails. But then you told the Wall Street Journal that the question about whether or not Secretary Clinton's e-mails compromised classified information were valid questions.  So which is it? Is it an issue or is it not?  	True	False	2
OBRADOVICH	I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.  Secretary Clinton, your response.  	True	False	2
TODD	Good evening, and welcome to the MSNBC Democratic candidates debate.  	True	False	5
TODD	And neither party has seen this yet. These candidates are both running for the Democratic nomination, but they are very different from each other when it comes to what matters most and how they would go about the job of being president. Our job tonight is to draw out those differences so you, the voters, can understand them and be fully informed.  	True	False	5
TODD	First, I want to say a special thanks to the New Hampshire Union Leader for helping make this debate possible, and the readers, who helped provide some of the questions and topics that we'll be addressing tonight.  The rules tonight, by the way, are simple: 90 seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals.  	True	False	5
TODD	Thank you, Senator. Secretary Clinton.  	True	False	5
TODD	"All right.  Let's get started.  Secretary Clinton, last night you cited the Concord Monitor when you said of Senator Sanders that, quote, ""It's very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable."" So please tell us why you think if he's elected president on a platform of promising things like free public college and universal healthcare, that he cannot achieve those things.  "	True	False	5
TODD	Thank you, Secretary.  Senator Sanders, so just explain how you spent nearly two decades in Congress and haven't gotten any of these things passed. Why do you think as president you'll be able to achieve big, big new programs like this?  	True	False	5

TODD	All right, thank you both. Rachel.  	True	False	5
TODD	I'd like to follow up on a comment that Secretary Clinton said, Senator. President Obama has not called for abolishing the death penalty. President Obama is for the big Asian trade deal known as TPP, and just yesterday you said you can't be both a moderate or a progressive, but you can't be both. Is President Obama, in your judgment, based on these policies positions, a progressive?  	True	False	5

TODD	All right, welcome back. Let's get right to it.  Senator Sanders, you were talking about all of your campaign contributions and campaign finance reform. You rail against big money in politics. But do you realize there is one public financing system that we do have in place, and it is—it is in place to run for president. Why aren't you walking the walk on that?  Why aren't you participating in the presidential public financing system which is designed to essentially keep big money out of presidential politics?  	True	False	5
TODD	Well, going on that then, why criticize her on Super PACs, and you got—and all this when it is—you know, that's the system? I mean, you could be participating in a publicly-financing—public financing system...  	True	False	5
TODD	... and being able to set—being able to set an example.  	True	False	5
TODD	... she has had more people praise her plan than yours.  	True	False	5
TODD	"Thank you both. Let me move on to our next question here, and in fact it comes to us through New England Cable News.  Secretary Clinton, it's addressed to you, and it's about this issue of the speeches, particularly to Goldman Sachs. This is what the questioner wrote verbatim.  ""I am concerned with the abuses of Wall Street has taken with the American taxpayers money,"" and then she asks whether you would release the transcripts of your Goldman Sachs speeches, and then added, ""Don't you think the voting public has a right to know what was said?""  But, let's make that bigger. Are you willing to release the transcripts of all your paid speeches? We do know through reporting that there were transcription services for all of those paid speeches. In full disclosure, would you release all of them?  "	True	False	5
TODD	Senator, you sound like you want to respond. Go ahead.  	True	False	5
TODD	We'll be right back. And we're going to get to trade and a lot of other issues. [applause]  [commercial break]  	True	False	5
TODD	Go ahead, Senator Sanders—30 seconds, your response.  	True	False	5
TODD	All right. Senator, I want to stay, though...  	True	False	5
TODD	Go ahead. 30 seconds.  	True	False	5
TODD	Let me—let—we're gonna—we're staying—we're staying basically on this topic. Obviously you've been emphasizing this difference on the Iraq war, but one place where you do agree, and one place where you voted to authorize the use of force, was in favor of the war in Afghanistan.  Right now, it is possible President Obama is going to be leaving the next president, perhaps President Sanders, at least 10,000 troops in Afghanistan. How long will those troops be in Afghanistan under President Sanders?  	True	False	5
TODD	Can you address a question on Afghanistan? [applause]  [crosstalk]  How long are these troops going to be there? If President Obama leaves you 10,000 troops, how long do you think they're going to be there?  	True	False	5
TODD	Secretary Clinton, 30 seconds: How long are these troops going to be in Afghanistan? We have more American troops in Afghanistan than what we were talking about with Iraq.  	True	False	5
TODD	You know, Senator Sanders, nobody knows who your foreign policy advisers are. You haven't given a major foreign policy speech. And it doesn't sound like all the time that foreign policy is a priority, other than when you're asked about it, and you say you're going to crush ISIS, as you said last night and earlier.  You have not proactively laid out a foreign policy doctrine yet. Why?  	True	False	5
TODD	All right, Senator, 30 seconds. [applause]  	True	False	5
TODD	30 seconds, madam secretary.  	True	False	5
TODD	Alright, as Commander in Chief, Senator Sanders, you've got to prioritize potential threats to the United States. Three countries, North Korea, Iran, Russia. How would you rank them in order of their threat to America's security right now...  	True	False	5
TODD	... Starting with the biggest threat.  	True	False	5
TODD	... I didn't say that...  	True	False	5
TODD	... No...  	True	False	5
TODD	... We already had that. I'm talking about these three countries. How would you orient our national security, our national defense posture.  	True	False	5
TODD	Secretary of Defense Ash Carter this week picked one of those three, and he has said Russia is, basically, the most important national security threat. Sort of reorienting the defense and the challenges to that. Do you agree with his decisions...  	True	False	5
TODD	Secretary Clinton, what do you think of Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. He's basically putting Russia above Iran, above North Korea, as sort of the chief national security challenge right now.  	True	False	5
TODD	Thank you both, Rachel?  	True	False	5
TODD	"And we are back. We're gonna get into a little bit of election politics, electability, in a little bit.  Senator Sanders, The Iowa Democratic Party has declared Hillary Clinton the winner of Monday's Iowa caucuses—narrowest of margins. Today, the Des Moines Register has an editorial that calls for the audit of the results, saying, quote, ""what happened Monday night at the Democratic caucuses was a debacle, period. The results were too close not to do a complete audit.""  Senator Sanders, do you accept the idea that Hillary Clinton won Iowa? And do you—or do you believe the caucuses are still an open question?  "	True	False	5
TODD	Secretary Clinton, will you participate in some sort of audit, if that's what the party wants to do? You good with that?  	True	False	5
TODD	That's fair enough. OK.  	True	False	5
TODD	Good, we move on. We're happy with that. We have more questions.  	True	False	5
TODD	We'll stay on this issue. We'll stay on this topic.  Secretary Clinton, just like there are some Democrats that question Senator Sanders' ability in the general election, many Democratic voters that our reporters have been running into in Iowa and New Hampshire, they tell our reporters over and over again they're worried about the emails issue, not because they don't believe your explanation, but because it's a drip-drip, because the cloud is hanging over your head and that it will impact the general election.  They see your numbers right now and they think it's the email issue as to why you're not polling very well. So can you reassure these Democrats that somehow the email issue isn't going to blow up your candidacy if you're the nominee?  	True	False	5
TODD	All right, Madam Secretary, there is an open—there is an open FBI investigation into this matter about how you may have handled classified material. Are you 100 percent confident that nothing is going to come of this FBI investigation?  	True	False	5
TODD	Well, Senator sanders, you famously at the first debate said you didn't give a darn about her emails; I think you used another [inaudible].  	True	False	5
TODD	You're right. I'm trying to—it's a—it's a family hour still right now. After 11:00, I'll say it the other way. And you mostly have refrained from commenting on it, but recently you called it a very serious issue, and then the other day you said well she's getting slapped with the email controversy.  Are you—how are you feeling about these darn emails now?  	True	False	5
TODD	OK. Senator Sanders, thank you. [applause]  	True	False	5
TODD	Secretary Clinton, let me turn to the issue of trade. In the '90s you supported NAFTA. But you opposed it when you ran for the president in 2008. As secretary of state, you supported TPP, and then—which, of course, is that trade agreement with a lot of Asian countries, but you now oppose it as you make your second bid for president.  If elected, should Democrats expect that once you're in office you will then become supportive of these trade agreements again?  	True	False	5
TODD	Well, Senator Sanders, I know you want to respond on this, you have never supported a trade deal since you've been in Congress.  	True	False	5
TODD	But if you do that as president...[applause]  If you do that as president, how are you not essentially letting China, who will do all of these deals around the world, how are you going to prevent China from essentially setting the rules of trade for the world?  	True	False	5
TODD	All right. Thank you both.  We're going to sneak in one more break here, and when we come back we'll squeeze as many questions as we can before we end this thing. We'll be right back. [applause]  [commercial break]  	True	False	5
TODD	All right. Welcome back here in the final minutes.  	True	False	5
TODD	The home stretch of this only Democratic debate in the final week before the primary.  Let me start with you, Secretary Clinton, on this question. Obviously, President Obama got a lot of ambitious stuff done in his first year and a half. You're going to have to make choices. And there's a lot of heavy lifts. And he made choices. He did healthcare and it came at the expense, arguably, of immigration reform. Had he put immigration reform first, perhaps that gets done and healthcare doesn't.  So there are three big lifts that you've talked about: immigration, gun reform, climate change. What do you do first? Because you know the first one is the one you have the best shot at getting done.  	True	False	5
TODD	All right, but Senator Sanders...[applause]...you've still got to do something first. As you know, history said—shows what you pick first is your best shot at getting, and how you prioritize things.  	True	False	5
TODD	Immigration reform, for instance, fell by the wayside in the first term because of this.  	True	False	5
TODD	OK. Thank you.  	True	False	5
TODD	All right, before we go, I want to ask each one of these. Secretary Clinton, you've made it clear when you look at Senator Sanders, you do not see a president, but do you see—  	True	False	5
TODD	But do you see—do you see a vice president? [laughter]  	True	False	5
TODD	Would you unite the party by trying to pick Senator Sanders as your running mate?  	True	False	5
TODD	Senator, would you consider the secretary?  	True	False	5
TODD	Secretary Clinton, closing statements. You are first.  	True	False	5
TODD	Thank you, Madam Secretary. Senator Sanders.  	True	False	5
TODD	Well, there you have it. I promise you, Rachel and I have a lot more questions, but we just don't have any more time, unless we could [inaudible] a third hour, but I don't think so.  Our debate coverage—[inaudible] debate coverage will continue in just a moment with our colleague [inaudible].  And we want to thank all of you for being here, and we want to thank the two candidates for taking part in this important event.  	True	False	5
TODD	We'll see you in a few minutes. Thank you.  	True	False	5
LEVESQUE	Here to New Hampshire again. As you know, this auditorium is filled with many Saint Anselm college students. They know the outstanding student debt right now in America is $1.3 trillion. That private education costs have gone up in the last decade 26 percent, and 40 percent for public education.  So knowing that, we know you want to make public education more affordable but how do you really lower the cost? Senator Sanders, you mentioned a few minutes ago that you want free tuition for public colleges.  	True	False	3
LEVESQUE	How does that really lower the cost other than just shifting the cost to taxpayers?  	True	False	3
LEVESQUE	Governor O'Malley, how do you propose -- Governor O'Malley, how do you propose lowering some of these costs associated with higher education?  O'MALLEY: Yes, this one falls under the category of, I have actually done this. As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.  My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees. So as a nation we need to increase what we invest in Pell grants. Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.  But states need to do more as well. And I propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well. I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.  I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace. My oldest daughter's a teacher. Um, and their mother's here as well. We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie? And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.  I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones. There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan. I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I. Bill.  But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills. That's a drag on the economy. It's one of the key investments we need to make. I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers. And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.  	True	False	3
BAIER	Nine p.m. on the East Coast. Eight o'clock here in Des Moines, Iowa. Welcome to the seventh Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign. I'm Bret Baier, along with my comoderators Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace.  	False	True	7
BAIER	Google sees political searches spike during televised presidential debates — no surprise there. But they spike by more than 440 percent on average, as voters across America seek to learn more about what's happening on the live debate stage.  	False	True	7
BAIER	Ohio Governor John Kasich. [applause] And Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. [applause]  	False	True	7
BAIER	Tonight's rules are simple. Up to 60 seconds for each answer, 30 seconds for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over the allotted time, you will hear this. [bell rings]  Double.  	False	True	7
BAIER	I think the double is the one we want. Very pleasing. [laughter]  We have a crowd of about 1,600 here, and while they have agreed to respect the candidates and listen intently, we can tell you they are very excited to be here. Am I right? [applause]  	False	True	7
BAIER	Governor Bush, it's hard for anyone of your pedigree to avoid being called establishment. But isn't that part of the problem in this race, that three others on this stage are splitting the main stream Republican vote and there by possibly handing this nomination over to an anti-establishment candidate?  	False	True	7
BAIER	Thank you governor.  	False	True	7
BAIER	Senator Paul, you are definitely not in the establishment category. But at the beginning of this campaign, you said you were your own man when asked about your father, former Texas Congressman and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul.  Senator Cruz's campaign is out with a video saying that Cruz is the intellectual and political heir to your father's 2012 campaign and the liberty movement. And your father now says it's realistic that Donald Trump will be your party's nominee.  So did you make a mistake by not fully — more fully embracing your father politically at the beginning of this campaign?  	False	True	7
BAIER	Senator Cruz, your response to that?  	False	True	7
BAIER	Senator Rubio?  	False	True	7
BAIER	Thank you, Senator.  	False	True	7
BAIER	We'll come back to...  	False	True	7
BAIER	OK. Go ahead, go ahead.  	False	True	7
BAIER	Welcome back. Let's get right back to the questions. Chris.  	False	True	7
BAIER	Governor Bush, just today, a wounded warrior organization designed to help wounded veterans and their families is coming under fire for raising tens of millions of dollars, but spending almost half of that on travel and hotels and dinners and luxury, lavish conferences. So taking care of veterans is obviously a huge issue in the country that has asked so many to serve and sacrifice so much.  If you were president. would you police these charity organizations that say they're helping vets?  	False	True	7
BAIER	Governor Bush, thank you. [applause]  Speaking of veterans, we have a question from a veteran who is one of the top Youtube creators. Over the course of the evening, gentlemen, we will hear from some of Youtube's most followed stars. And here's one of them.  	False	True	7
BAIER	Senator Paul, that question to you.  	False	True	7
BAIER	Senator Paul, thank you.  	False	True	7
BAIER	Thank you, Megyn.  Gentlemen, I'll ask you some questions about federal spending and the role of the federal government. Everybody always said they want to cut federal spending and usually they start by saying they'll cut waste, fraud, and abuse, but that really doesn't ever materialize. We all know that.  Governor Christie, you talk a lot about entitlement reform and you say that that's where the federal government can get savings needed to balance the budget. But can you name even one thing that the federal government does now that it should not do at all?  	False	True	7
BAIER	I want one. Yes. [laughter]  	False	True	7
BAIER	Anything bigger than that?  	False	True	7
BAIER	"And, Governor, I realize everyone on this stage opposes Obamacare and you're not alone. Google Data shows that in the last month when people searched ""policy repeals,"" that there were a lot of them. Obamacare took the top two spots. But today there are millions of people who gained health insurance from Obamacare and they now rely on it.  So the question, Senator Cruz, if you repeal Obamacare, as you say you will, will you be fine if millions of those people don't have health insurance? And what is your specific plan for covering the uninsured?  "	False	True	7
BAIER	Senator Cruz, thank you.  Governor Bush, you've advocated for statehood for Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican economy is collapsing under unsustainable debt burden. Only about 1 million of its 4 million residents are currently employed. So should American citizens who you say are already overtaxed, bail out Puerto Rico as well?  	False	True	7
BAIER	Governor Kasich, you're one of two remaining sitting governors still in the race. Your colleague, Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan is under fire — he and his administration — for the Flint, Michigan water crisis and the botched response to it. How would you have handled that?  	False	True	7
BAIER	Senator Rubio, on the issue of climate change, in 2008, you wanted Florida to get ahead of other states and establish a cap- and-trade system, a program for carbon emissions, which many Republicans thought at the time would hurt the Florida economy. Now, you're a skeptic of climate change science. And in fact, you warn that federal efforts to fight climate change will cost U.S. jobs and hurt the U.S. economy.  So why the change?  	False	True	7
BAIER	Thanks, Senator.  	False	True	7
BAIER	Thank you.  	False	True	7
BAIER	Senator Rubio, first before I ask you a question, any response to Governor Bush?  	False	True	7
BAIER	"Now let's talk about electability, Senator. TIME magazine once called you ""the Republican savior."" Rush Limbaugh and others said you likely will be president some day.  But if you look at the recent average of polls in your home state of Florida, you're in third trailing Donald trump by 24 points. If the people who know you best have you there, why should the rest of the country elect you?  "	False	True	7
BAIER	Thank you, Senator.  	False	True	7
BAIER	"Much more to come, including where the candidates stand on foreign policy. And, once again, you can go to Google.com, or open your Google search app and search, ""Fox News Debate"" to vote on which candidate you think is winning the debate tonight. We'll be right back.  [commercial break]  "	False	True	7
BAIER	Gentlemen. [applause]  I'd like to ask you a few questions about foreign policy broadly.  Dr. Carson, many experts believe Russian leader Vladimir Putin has greater ideas, bigger designs for the region beyond Russia's actions inside Ukraine. Fast forward to February 2017 and it is President Carson, and Russian uniformed commandos cross the Estonian border and they occupy a city in Estonia. Estonia, a member of NATO, essentially invokes Article IV, an attack on one is an attack on all. What do you do?  	False	True	7
BAIER	Gentlemen, you've all said that the Iran nuclear deal is a bad one.  Senator Rubio, you were among the candidates who've said you would tear it up on day one. But as you know, Iran has already received tens of millions of dollars — tens of billions of dollars in this deal and has quickly reestablished ties economically with Europe.  The major concessions, in other words, are up front in this deal. So should you win by the time you take office, the remaining parts of the deal would be the constraints on Iran. So why blow up those constraints on day one, letting Iran off the hook?  	False	True	7
BAIER	Governor Kasich, you've said that Marco Rubio is wrong... [applause] ... that Senator Rubio is wrong with tearing it up on day one.  	False	True	7
BAIER	But Governor Kasich, you know that the most powerful sanctions are the multilateral ones.  	False	True	7
BAIER	And these European countries are already reestablishing these ties.  	False	True	7
BAIER	They don't want...  	False	True	7
BAIER	Governor, thank you. Governor Christie... [applause] ... Libya is the newest base for ISIS. Just today, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said ISIS is consolidating their footprint there and also setting up training facilities.  So if you were president, would you deploy U.S. troops to Libya to take out ISIS there?  	False	True	7
BAIER	Thank you, Governor. [applause]  	False	True	7
BAIER	Welcome back to Des Moines. Let's resume the debate. Megyn?  	False	True	7
BAIER	Coming up, closing statements from the candidates as our debate continues, live, from Des Moines, Iowa.  [commercial break]  	False	True	7
BAIER	New Jersey governor, Chris Christie.  	False	True	7
BAIER	Thank you governor. [applause]  	False	True	7
BAIER	Florida Senator Marco Rubio.  	False	True	7
BAIER	Thank you senator.  	False	True	7
BAIER	And we have you covered from Iowa, all the way to the conventions and on to the general election. Thanks again for joining us. For all of us here in Des Moines, have a great evening.	False	True	7
PAUL	You know, I've always had a great deal of respect. There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father. I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.  And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country. I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.  You know, Ted didn't show up. We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn't have time to show up. He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.  And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household. I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.  The NSA is another big issue. Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.  I don't think Ted can have it both ways. They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote. But we don't see it happening at all. We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote. [applause]  	False	True	7
PAUL	May I respond?  [crosstalk]  	False	True	7
PAUL	Well, I mean, I was talked about in the question.  	False	True	7
PAUL	Just very quickly, I would like to respond.  The bulk collection of your phone data, the invasion of your privacy did not stop one terrorist attack. I don't think you have to give up your liberty for a false sense of security.  When we look at this bulk collection, the court has looked at this. Even the court declared it to be illegal. If we want to collect the records of terrorists, let's do it the old fashioned way. Let's use the Fourth Amendment. Let's put a name on a warrant, let's ask a judge for it. Let's respect the history of our country.  John Adams said that we fought a War for Independence because we wanted to fight against generalized warrants. Let's don't forget that. [applause]  	False	True	7
PAUL	My budget was mentioned. My budget was mentioned.  	False	True	7
PAUL	... Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond...  	False	True	7
PAUL	... and I'd like to respond.  	False	True	7
PAUL	Thank you, Marco.  	False	True	7
PAUL	Thank you.  The issue in Syria's a very important one, and it's one we need to get right. The question is, should we be bombing both sides of the war? Some want to topple Assad. In fact, they want to bomb ISIS and Assad simultaneously.  I think that's a really, really bad idea. In fact, I've said for several years that arming the allies of ISIS will make the situation worse, That what we really need to do is defeat ISIS.  But if you defeat Assad, what you will wind up with is a larger and more powerful ISIS that occupies that space. You might — you may well see an ISIS that takes over all of Syria. [bell rings]  	False	True	7
PAUL	[inaudible].  	False	True	7
PAUL	"Yeah, no, I think that's a — that's a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques. But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security. And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.  When he brought forward the ""Gang of Eight"" bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.  Marco opposed this because they made a deal. He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments. And I think that's a mistake, and I just don't think Marco can have it both ways. You can't be in favor of defend us... [bell rings] ... against Islam — radical Islam — if you're not for border security.  "	False	True	7
PAUL	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras. I've been to Ferguson, I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.  One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines. People were just being fined to death. Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it. If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.  I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.  In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men. Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons — three out of four people in prison are black or brown. I think something has to change. I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform. [applause]  	False	True	7
PAUL	"I was there and I saw the debate. I saw Ted Cruz say, ""we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill.""  The bill would involve legalization. He can't have it both ways. But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, ""you're for amnesty."" Everybody's for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.  But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem — that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty. I was for legalization. I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization. So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so. That's not true.  "	False	True	7
PAUL	You know, I think abortion is always wrong. I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal. In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.  But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue — requires a virtuous people. In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.  Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint. There's a lot packed into that statement. But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation. The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.  But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way. I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.  	False	True	7
PAUL	Both. No, both the federal and a state approach. I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well. So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.  But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states. So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade — Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue. If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.  I think it would be better the more — the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.  	False	True	7
PAUL	You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question. I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this. I don't think she's responsible for his behavior. But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired. They would never be hired again. [applause]  Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community. And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior. So it is difficult.  	False	True	7
PAUL	Yeah. But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle. [applause]  	False	True	7
PAUL	Well, thanks for having me. It's great to be back. [applause]  I'm an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I miss doing eye surgery, still get to do a little bit. Did a couple of cataract surgeries over Christmas holidays. Got to go to Haiti last year. I've gotten to do some incredible things. Got to be on the floor of the Senate. And it has been amazing to me.  But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding. And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending. And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget.  Thank you. [applause]  	False	True	7
BASH	A crucial question is how to balance surveillance with privacy and keeping Americans safe.  Senator Cruz, you voted for a bill that President Obama signed into law just this past June that made it harder for the government to access Americans' phone records. In light of the San Bernardino attack, was your vote a mistake?  	False	True	5
BASH	Thank you.  Senator Rubio, Senator Cruz is right there was bipartisan support for that. But you voted against it. So, is Senator Cruz wrong?  	False	True	5
BASH	Senator Cruz?  	False	True	5
BASH	Senator — Senator — Senator Rubio, please respond.  	False	True	5
BASH	Senator Paul, Senator Paul, I know this is — this has been a very big issue for you. You hear many of your colleagues are calling for increased surveillance by law enforcement. You call that hogwash. Why is that hogwash?  	False	True	5
BASH	Senator Rubio?  	False	True	5
BASH	Governor Christie, Governor Christie... [crosstalk] [applause] ...Governor Christie, I'll come to you in a minute. Go ahead, Senator Paul.  	False	True	5
BASH	Go ahead, please.  	False	True	5
BASH	Senator, we're going to talk about immigration in a while. But, Governor Christie, just listening to this...  	False	True	5
BASH	Listening to this, you talked — you heard Senator Paul, Senator Cruz talk about how important it is to protect Americans' privacy, even in a time of grave danger. Why — what's wrong with that?  	False	True	5
BASH	Senator Paul, you said ISIS grew stronger because of the hawks in your party. Do you really think that Republicans have fueled the rise of ISIS?  	False	True	5
BASH	Senator Paul, Senator Paul, I want to go back to my initial question, which is you saying that ISIS grew stronger because of hawks in your party. And do you think your own party, the people who you're describing, are responsible for the rise of ISIS?  	False	True	5
BASH	Senator, we're going to talk about regime change in a bit.  But Governor Kasich, would you like to respond to Senator Paul?  	False	True	5
BASH	Thank you, Dr. Carson. We've been talking tonight about programs and policy proposals that you all have to keep Americans safe and it's a big discussion on the campaign trail. Also about border security and immigration. So let's talk about immigration.  Senator Rubio. You co-authored a bill with Democrats two years ago that allowed a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Do you still support that path to citizenship, which means giving those immigrants rights, like the right to vote?  	False	True	5
BASH	Senator, you haven't answered the question. You described a very long path but does that path end at citizenship?  	False	True	5
BASH	Thank you, senator.  	False	True	5
BASH	Thank you, senator. Senator Cruz. [applause] Senator Cruz, on the campaign trail, Senator Rubio has said that his immigration plan is not that different from yours. Is that true?  	False	True	5
BASH	Senator Rubio, please.  	False	True	5
BASH	Senator Cruz?  	False	True	5
BASH	Senator Cruz?  	False	True	5

BASH	Mr. Trump, you like to say that you restarted this conversation in the campaign.  	False	True	5
BASH	So who do you side with? Who do you side with in this, Senator Rubio or Senator Cruz?  	False	True	5
BASH	Thank you.  Governor Bush?  	False	True	5
BASH	Listening to this, do you think this is the tone — this immigration debate that republicans need to take to win back Hispanics into our party especially states like where we are in Nevada that has a pretty Hispanic community?  	False	True	5
BASH	"Governor Christie, you've said if China launches a cyber- attack against the U.S. on your watch, ""they're going to see cyber- warfare like they have never seen before."" What exactly would that response look like?  "	False	True	5
BASH	Governor Bush, what you just heard from Governor Christie, are you concerned that that could really escalate with China, that they would retaliate? And, for example, as the NSA has said, attack the U.S. and maybe it's power grid, which the Chinese have the capability to do?  	False	True	5
BASH	Mr. Trump, just this weekend you said Senator Cruz is not qualified to be president because he doesn't have the right temperament and acted like a maniac when he arrived in the Senate. But last month you said you were open to naming Senator Cruz as your running mate.  	False	True	5
BASH	So why would you be willing to put somebody who's a maniac one heartbeat away from the presidency?  	False	True	5
BASH	Okay.  Senator Cruz. Senator Cruz, you have not been willing to attack Mr. Trump in public.  	False	True	5
BASH	But you did question his judgment in having control of American's nuclear arsenal during a private meeting with supporters. Why are you willing to say things about him in private and not in public?  	False	True	5
BASH	Senator, senator, I just...  	False	True	5
BASH	Senator, a lot of people have seen...  	False	True	5
BASH	... a lot of people have seen these comments you made in private. I just want to clarify what you're saying right now is you do believe Mr. Trump has the judgment to be commander in chief?  	False	True	5
FRANTA	Hi, I'm Connor Franta, I'm 23 and my audience is around the same age. Getting my generation to vote should be a priority for any presidential candidate.  Now I know Senator Sanders is pretty popular among my peers, but what I want to know is, how are all of you planning on engaging us further in this election?  [end video clip]  	True	False	4
EPPERSON	Thank you, John.  Mrs. Fiorina, you were the CEO of a large corporation that offers a 401(k) to its employees. But more than half of American have no access to an employer sponsored retirement plan.  That includes the workers at small businesses, and the growing ranks of Uber drivers and other part-timers in the freelance economy.  Should the Federal Government play a larger role in helping to set up retirement plans for these workers?  	False	True	3
EPPERSON	So you wouldn't agree -- you wouldn't agree with a start for 401(k) for businesses or anything like that?  	False	True	3
EPPERSON	Thank you very much.  	False	True	3
EPPERSON	Thank you, the rules say one minute.  	False	True	3
EPPERSON	Thank you, Ms. Fiorina. We appreciate it. Thank you, thank you.  I want to turn my attention now, to you now, Governor Kasich.  Most people can't get a college degree without going into debt. Over 40 million Americans have student loans and many of them cannot pay them back.  This country has over $100 billion in student loan defaults. That's billion with a b.  What will you do to make sure that students, their families, taxpayers, won't feel the economic impact of this burden for generations?  Well, first of all, in Ohio we're changing the whole system. Universities will not get paid one dime unless the student graduates or -- graduates or completes a course.  Secondly, you can be in high school and complete almost an entire first year before you go to college and get credit to do that. And, of course, in addition to that, we are working now to go after the cost drivers in our universities. And let me give you an example. Universities today have so many non-academic assets. At Ohio State they sold the parking garage and the parking lot, and they got $500 million because they shouldn't be in the parking lot business. They shouldn't be in the ding business, they shouldn't be in the dorm business.  And, of course, we need to take advantage of on-line education to reduce these costs and begin to dis-intermediate the cost of four years.  Now, for those who that have these big high costs, I think we can seriously look at an idea of where you can do public service. I mean legitimate, public service and begin to pay off some of that debt through the public service that you do. And in the meantime, it may inspire us to care more about our country, more about ourselves.  This is a big moral issue in America. Living a life bigger than yourself, and being a center of healing and justice. And people can learn it through public service.  	False	True	3
EPPERSON	Thank you, thank you.  	False	True	3
SANDERS	Rachel, thank you very much.  Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process. And they're giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged.  They are working longer hours for low wages. They're worried about the future of their kids, and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. Not what America is supposed to be about. Not the fairness that we grew up believing that America was about. And then sustaining that rigged economy is a corrupt campaign finance system undermining American democracy, where billionaire, Wall Street, corporate America can contribute unlimited sums of money into super PACs and into candidates.  Our job, together, is to end a rigged economy, create an economy that works for all, and absolutely overturn Citizens United. One person, one vote. That's what American democracy is about.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Well, I haven't quite run for president before. [laughter and applause]  Let's deal with some of the comments that Secretary Clinton made. And by the way, you know, sometimes there's a lot of drama here. I have known Secretary Clinton for 25 years and respect her very much.  Here is the issue. Every major country on earth, whether it's the U.K., whether it's France, whether it's Canada, has managed to provide healthcare to all people as a right and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are. So I do not accept the belief that the United States of America can't do that.  I do not accept the belief that the United States of America and our government can't stand up to the ripoffs of the pharmaceutical industry which charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.  Number two, in the economy today, everybody understands that we need a well educated workforce. This is 2016. When we talk about public education, it can no longer be K through 12th grade. I do believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition free. Well, how do we pay for that? It's an expensive proposition.  I do believe that we should substantially lower student debt in this country, which is crushing millions of people. We pay for it, in my view, by a tax on Wall Street speculation. The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need. Now, it is Wall Street's time to help the middle class. [applause]  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Let me...  	True	False	5
SANDERS	... this is a good discussion here.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	And let me just say this. As Secretary Clinton may know, I am on the Health Education Labor Committee. That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act. The idea I would dismantle health care in America while we're waiting to pass a Medicare for all is just not accurate. The Affordable Care Act has clearly, as Secretary Clinton made the point, done a lot of good things, but, what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance, we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall.  So I do believe that in the future, not by dismantling what we have here—I helped write that bill—but by moving forward, rallying the American people, I do believe we should have health care for all. [applause]  	True	False	5
SANDERS	No, not at all. Here's the reality of American economic life today. The reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process. The reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1/10th of 1 percent. The reality is we that have a corrupt campaign finance system which separates the American people's needs and desires from what Congress is doing. So to my mind, what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process, stand up and fight back, demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution—contributors.  Now all of the ideas that I'm talking about, they are not radical ideas. Making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. That is not a radical idea.  What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors. When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Let me just pick up on this point. This whole discussion began because I commented, not making overall evaluation about the Secretary. She was in Ohio, I think, in September or November and she got up and said something like, I have been—I'm paraphrasing, I have been criticized because people think I'm a moderate. Well, I am a moderate.  That's where this came from. It wasn't me paraphrasing her. It is what she said, and all that I said was there's nothing wrong with being a moderate. But, you can't be a moderate, you can't a progressive.  In terms of President Obama, I think if we remember where this country was seven years ago, 800,000 jobs being lost every month, $1.4 trillion dollar deficit. The world's financial system on the verge of collapse. I think that President Obama, Vice President Biden, and the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate have done a fantastic job. We are in much better shape than we were seven years ago, although my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago. That's the fact, but, we still have a very long way to go.  Do I think President Obama is a progressive? Yes, I do. I disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement. But, yes, I think he has done an excellent job.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	That's right, I mean, instead of arguing about definitions, let's talk about...  	True	False	5
SANDERS	... What we should do, and one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk, but walk the walk. I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a Super PAC, who's not raising huge sums of money from Wall Street...[applause]... And special interests. I am enormously proud. Never believed it would happen that we have raised 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 dollars a piece. That is what the political revolution means. [applause]  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Well, Rachel, actually, that wasn't accurate. In 1988 the Republican did win, I believe, by 3 points. I came in second. It was 34-31, I think, 19 for the Democrat. In that race the Democrat was the spoiler, not me. And it is true...[laughter and applause]...it is true, it's not to be denied, I am the longest- serving independent in the history of the United States Congress. People of Vermont sent me to Washington as an independent. That is true.  But on the other hand, I have—when I was in the House for 16 years, I caucused with the Democrats. In the Senate for nine years caucused with the Democrats, of course. And I was elected by the Democrats to be chair of the Veterans Committee three years ago, which I'm very proud of. And now am the rankings member on the Budget Committee, leader of the Democrats in opposition to the majority Republicans.  I am running for president as a Democrat. And if elected, not only do I hope to bring forth a major change in national priorities, but let me be frank, I do want to see major changes in the Democratic Party.  I want to see working people and young people come into the party in a way that doesn't exist now. And you know what, I want a 50-state strategy so the Democratic Party is not just the party of 25 states. [applause]  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Well, I don't see it quite like that.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	I am—will absolutely admit that Secretary Clinton has the support of far more governors, mayors, members of the House. She has the entire establishment or almost the entire establishment behind her. That's a fact. I don't deny it.  But I am pretty proud that we have over a million people who have contributed to our campaign averaging 27 bucks apiece. That we have had meetings where 25,000-30,000 people have come out. That our campaign is a campaign of the people, by the people, and for the people.  So, Rachel, yes, Secretary Clinton does represent the establishment. I represent, I hope, ordinary Americans, and by the way, who are not all that enamored with the establishment, but I am very proud to have people like Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva in the House, the co-chairmen of the House Progressive Caucus.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	What being part of the establishment is, is, in the last quarter, having a super PAC that raised $15 million from Wall Street, that throughout one's life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests.  To my mind, if we do not get a handle on money in politics and the degree to which big money controls the political process in this country, nobody is going to bring about the changes that is needed in this country for the middle class and working families.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	What... [applause]  	True	False	5
SANDERS	... you know...  	True	False	5
SANDERS	[inaudible]. [applause]  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Let's talk about—OK, let's talk...  	True	False	5
SANDERS	... let us talk about issues.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Let's talk about issues.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Let's...  	True	False	5
SANDERS	... let's—let's—let's talk about issues.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Let's talk—let's talk about issues, all right? Let's talk about why, in the 1990s, Wall Street got deregulated. Did it have anything to do with the fact that Wall Street provided—spent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions?  Well, some people might think, yeah, that had some influence. [laughter]  Let's ask why it is that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, and your medicine can be doubled tomorrow, and there's nothing that the government can do to stop it.  You think it has anything to do with the huge amounts of campaign contributions and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry? Let's talk about climate change.  Do you think there's a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and that we need to transform our energy system? Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system?  That is what goes on in America. I am not—I like...[applause]...there is a reason. You know, there is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system. And in my view, it is undermining American democracy and it is allowing Congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this country.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	I think as Secretary Clinton knows, there is nobody who fought harder. I was on the House Financial Committee at that time. I heard the arguments coming from Democrats and Republicans—Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan—about great an idea it would be if we did away with Glass-Steagall and if we allowed investor banks and commercial banks and big insurance companies to merge.  Go to YouTube today. Look up Greenspan-Sanders. Listen to what I told them then. I helped lead the effort against deregulation. Unfortunately, we lost that. The result is—was the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Chuck, actually we looked at it, but it turns out to be a disaster. The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well. But in terms of the early states—Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states—it just doesn't work.  Your point is well taken. I believe in public funding of elections, absolutely. But this system is—I don't know if the secretary would agree—is currently very antiquated and no longer applies to modern day politics.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	But if the...  	True	False	5
SANDERS	—but Chuck, it is a public financing system that everybody knows is antiquated. It no longer works. Nobody can become president based on that system. So what's the alternative? There are two alternatives. And, you know, we looked at it. Well, should we do a Super PAC, but I concluded, honestly, I don't represent Corporate America or billionaires, I didn't want it.  So the other alternative was to ask working families and the middle class to help out in a transformational campaign. And you know what? We got 3.5 million individual contributions, $27 a piece. I think that's pretty good. [applause]  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Let me just say this. Wall Street is perhaps the most powerful economic and political force in this country. You have companies like Goldman Sachs, who just recently paid a settlement fine with the federal government for $5 billion for defrauding investors.  Goldman Sachs was one of those companies whose illegal activity helped destroy our economy and ruin the lives of millions of Americans. But this is what a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system and a broken criminal justice is about. These guys are so powerful that not one of the executives on Wall Street has been charged with anything after paying, in this case of Goldman Sachs, a $5 billion fine.  Kid gets caught with marijuana, that kid has a police record. A Wall Street executive destroys the economy, $5 billion settlement with the government, no criminal record. That is what power is about. That is what corruption is about. And that is what has to change in the United States of America. [applause]  [crosstalk]  	True	False	5
SANDERS	I would say that—that folks who have looked at this issue for a long time, whether it's Elizabeth Warren or many other economists, will tell you that right now, yes, we do need a 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation. And I would tell you also that when you have three out of the four largest banks in America today, bigger than they were—significantly bigger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, a good Republican by the way, what he would say is: Break them up; they are too powerful economically; they are too powerful politically.  And that is what I believe and many economists believe. Time to break them up. [applause]  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Well, we've had a number of economists supporting our legislation. And here's where we are. The American people can judge. Six largest financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly $10 trillion; equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of the United States of America.  That is a lot of money. They issue two thirds of the credit cards, and by the way they're ripping off a whole lot of people with high interest rates on the credit cards, and they write about one third of the mortgages.  That is a lot of power for six financial institutions. That's it. I think it is too much power. Too much economic power, too much political power, and the economists that I talk to say we should break them up.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Yeah, I do. I agree with much of what the Secretary said, but, madam Secretary, it is not one streak. Wall Street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power. That's a fact.  And, I want to say something, and it may sound harsh, not to you, but to the American people. In a sense, in my view, the business model of Wall Street is fraud. It's fraud. I believe that corruption is rampant, and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multi billion dollar settlements with the United States government when we have a weak regulator system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once, if we don't start breaking them up, we're going to have to bail them out again, and I do not want to see that happen...  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Of course I can work with them, but let's be clear. When I talked about Boeing and I talked about General Electric, what I was referring to is an outrage. I suspect the secretary agrees request me.  Right now you have a loophole such that these guys are putting their profits, multi-billion dollar profitable corporations putting billions of dollars into the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and other tax havens.  And in a given year, Rachel, after making billions of dollars in profit, do you know how much they're paying in taxes to the United States government in a given year? Zero. Now explain to me how that makes any sense at all.  So what I have said with regard to Boeing and GE and other multinationals that pay zero taxes, you know what we're going to do? We're going to end that loophole. They are going to pay their fair share of taxes.  We're going to use that money to rebuild our infrastructure and create up to 13 million jobs.  Can I work with corporations? Are there good corporations doing incredible cutting edge research and development? Absolutely they are. And we should be proud of them.  But on the other hand, there are many corporations who have turned their backs on the American worker, who have said, if I can make another nickel in profit by going to China and shutting down in the United States of America, that's what I will do.  I will do my best to transform our trade policy and take on these corporations who want to invest in low-income countries around the world rather than in the United States of America. [applause]  	True	False	5
SANDERS	OK. Let me agree with much of what the secretary said, but where we have a different background on this issue is we differ on the war in Iraq, which created barbaric organizations like ISIS.  Not only did I vote against that war, I helped lead the opposition, and if you go to my website, berniesanders.com, you will see the statement that I made in 2002. And it gives me no pleasure to tell you that much of what I feared would happen the day after Saddam Hussein was overthrown, in fact, did happen.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	"Well, I think our great task is to make certain that our young men and women in the military do not get sucked into never- ending, perpetual warfare within the quagmire of Syria and Iraq. And I will do my very best to make sure that that doesn't happen.  I agree with the secretary that I think what has to happen—and let me just mention what King Abdullah of Jordan said. I think he hit the nail on the head.  And what he said is essentially the war against ISIS is a war for the soul of Islam. And it must be Muslim troops on the ground that will destroy ISIS, with the support of a coalition of major powers—U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Russia.  So our job is to provide them the military equipment that they need; the air support they need; special forces when appropriate. But at the end of the day for a dozen different reasons, not the least of which is that ISIS would like American combat troops on the ground so they could reach out to the Muslim world and say, ""Look, we're taking on those terrible Americans.""  The combat on the ground must be done by Muslim troops with our support. We must not get involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.  "	True	False	5
SANDERS	Well, you can't simply withdraw tomorrow. Wish we could, and allow, you know, the Taliban or anybody else to reclaim that country. But what we must do, and what we have seen in recent months, is some progress in Iraq, where finally the Iraqi army, which has not been a particularly effective fighting force, retook Ramadi. ISIS has lost I think 40 percent of the territory that it held in the last year.  Hopefully, and you know, one can't predict the future, that maybe our training and their fighting capabilities are improving and we are going to make some progress in destroying ISIS.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Well, that's not quite accurate. I did give a speech at Georgetown where I talked about democratic socialism and foreign policy. Maybe I shouldn't have combined the two in the same speech, because the foreign policy part of it didn't get much attention. So, let me take this opportunity to give you a very short speech here on the issue.  I think, while it is true that the secretary and I voted differently on the war in Iraq, what is important is that we learn the lesson of the war in Iraq. And that lesson is intrinsic to my foreign policy if elected president, is the United States cannot do it alone. We cannot be the policeman of the world. We are now spending more I believe than the next eight countries on defense. We have got to work in strong coalition with the major powers of the world and with those Muslim countries that are prepared to stand up and take on terrorism.  So I would say that the key doctrine of the Sanders administration would be no, we cannot continue to do it alone; we need to work in coalition. [applause]  [crosstalk]  	True	False	5
SANDERS	[off-mike] I fully, fully concede that Secretary Clinton, who was secretary of State for four years, has more experience—hat is not arguable—in foreign affairs. But experience is not the only point, judgment is. And once again, back in 2002, when we both looked at the same evidence about the wisdom of the war in Iraq, one of us voted the right way and one of us didn't.  In terms of Iran and in terms of Saudi Arabia, of course they hate each other. That's no great secret. But John Kerry, who is I think doing a very good job, has tried to at least get these people in the room together because both of them are being threatened by ISIS.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Well...  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Who said That think we should normalize relations with Iran tomorrow? I never said that. I think we should move forward as quickly as we can.  And you're right. They are a sponsor of terrorism around the world and we have to address that. But you know, a number of years ago, people were saying normal relationship with Cuba, what a bad and silly idea. They're Communists, they are our enemy. Well guess what? Change has come.  So please don't suggest that I think we normalize relations with Tehran tomorrow. We don't. But I would like to see us move forward, and hopefully some day that will happen. And I would say if I might, Madam Secretary—and you can correct me if I'm wrong. When you ran against Senator Obama you thought him naive because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies. I think those are exactly the people you have to talk to and you have to negotiate with. [applause]  	True	False	5
SANDERS	OK.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	I think President Obama had the right idea, and the bottom line is that of course there have to be conditions. But, of course it doesn't do us any good to not talk with our adversaries...  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Just to set the record straight, I very strongly supported the agreement which makes certain that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	... ISIS...  	True	False	5
SANDERS	ISIS, you forgot one...  	True	False	5
SANDERS	... No, no...  	True	False	5
SANDERS	... ISIS would be ...  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Clearly North Korea is a very strange situation because it is such an isolated country run by a handful of dictators, or maybe just one, who seems to be somewhat paranoid. And, who had nuclear weapons.  And, our goal there, in my view, is to work and lean strongly on China to put as much pressure. China is one of the few major countries in the world that has significant support for North Korea, and I think we got to do everything we can to put pressure on China. I worry very much about an isolated, paranoid country with atomic bombs.  I think, clearly, we got to work closely with China to resolve the serious problems we have, and I worry about Putin and his military adventurism in the Crimea and the Ukraine.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	... No, I don't. I worry very, very much about an isolated country. That's what makes me nervous. Russia lives in the world. China lives in the world. North Korea is a very, very strange country because it is so isolated, and I do feel that a nation with nuclear weapons, they have got to be dealt with. Dealt with effectively.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Let me agree. You know, as the secretary knows, I chaired—I had the privilege and the honor of chairing the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. And it is interesting to me, you know, Republicans give a lot of speeches about how much they love veterans. I work with the American Legion, the VFW, the DAV, the Vietnam Vets, and virtually every veterans organization to put together the most comprehensive piece of the veterans legislation in the modern history of America. That's what I did.  And I brought it to the floor of the Senate. Every Democrat voted for it, I got two Republicans. We ended up with 56 votes and I couldn't get the 60 votes that I needed. That is pathetic.  This was legislation supported by all of the veterans organizations, addressing many of the serious problems that veterans face in health care and in how we deliver benefits to them.  So Republicans talk a good game about veterans, but when it came to put money on the line to protect our veterans, frankly, they were not there.  What I did next, Rachel, is I had to retreat a little bit, I had to compromise. I did work with John McCain. I did work with Jeff Miller over in the House. And we put together not the bill that I wanted, but probably the most comprehensive V.A. health care bill in the modern history of this country.  Secretary Clinton is absolutely right, there are people, Koch brothers among others, who have a group called Concerned Veterans of America, funded by the Koch brothers. The Koch brothers, by the way, want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, every governmental program passed since the 1930s. Yes, there are people out there who want to privatize it.  The last point that I'd make. I had a hearing. I had all of the veterans groups in front of me. And I said to them, tell me when a veteran gets in to the V.A., understanding there are waiting lines and real problems, when a veteran gets into the system, is the quality of care good?  Without exception, what they said, good, excellent, very good. We've got to strengthen the V.A. We do not privatize the V.A. [applause]  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Well, I agree with the Des Moines Register, but let's not blow this out of proportion. This is not a—this is not, like, a winner-take-all thing.  I think where we now stand—correct me if I'm wrong—you have 22 delegates, I have 20 delegates. We need 2,500 delegates to win the nomination. [laughter]  You know, so this is not—this is not the biggest deal in the world. We think, by the way, based on talking to our precinct captains, we may have at least two more delegates.  What the Des Moines Register said—you know, there were coin—I think there were half a dozen coin flips—a fairly chaotic type situation. At the end of the day, no matter how it's recounted, it will break roughly even.  And by the way, I love and respect the caucus process in Iowa. See, and I don't have to say it, because they voted already. [laughter]  And I love New Hampshire, too, because you haven't voted, but...[applause]...but, look, I think people are blowing this up out of proportion. But I think we need improvements in the process by which results are determined.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Oh [inaudible]. [laughter]  See, when you are old, then they go back all these years. All right. What have you got?  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Well, you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process. But let me just say this. In terms of where we are right now, as you mention, Rachel, in a number of national and state, including New Hampshire. For example, the last poll I saw—there may have been a new one—last one I saw here in New Hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating Trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one. There were also pretty large margins in Iowa and Wisconsin.  These are polls. Polls go up. Polls go down. But here's why I think I will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate. Democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process.  Republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression. I believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout.  If there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the White House, but I think we regain the Senate. We win governors' chairs up and down the line. So I believe if you want to retain the White House, if you want to see Democrats do well across the board, I think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win. [applause]  	True	False	5
SANDERS	[off-mike]  	True	False	5
SANDERS	I am feeling exactly the way I felt at the first debate. There's a process under way. I will not politicize it.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	And by the way—and by the way, if I may, the secretary probably doesn't know that there's not a day that goes by when I am not asked to attack her on that issue, and I have refrained from doing that and I will continue to refrain from doing that. [applause]  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Not losing control of our campaign. You know, we have hired a whole lot of people in a rapid way and I am familiar with the first two instances and they are unacceptable, and we have apologized and dealt with that.  In terms of the last one, as I understand it, we did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper. Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates, and to the best of my knowledge, that is what we did. So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not. What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	But that was only for—that was not to be on television. That's an important point. That was just something—as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none, that said that those newspapers had endorsed us.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	... Look, I hear what the Secretary said, and I understand, but look, there are—all of us know that we have seen in recent years horrible, horrible crimes. It's hard to imagine how people can do, bomb, and kill 168 people in Oklahoma City, or do the Boston Marathon bombing, but this is what I believe, and for a couple of reasons.  Number one, too many innocent people, including minorities, African Americans, have been executed when they were not guilty. That's number one. We have to be very careful about making sure about that.  But, second of all, and maybe, in a deeper reason, of course there are barbaric acts out there. But, in a world of so much violence and killing, I just don't believe that government itself should be part of the killing. So, when somebody commits...[applause]...somebody commits any of these terrible crimes that we have seen, you lock them up, and you toss away the key. They're never going to get out. But, I just don't' want to see government be part of killing. That's all. [applause]  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Absolutely. I think the Secretary described the situation appropriately.  You know, I don't go around asking for governor's resignations every day. In fact, I think I never have in my life. But I did ask for the resignation of Governor Snyder because his irresponsibility...[applause]...was so outrageous.  What we are talking about are children being poisoned. That's what we're talking about. We don't know, no one knows for sure because they haven't done the appropriate studies, but there's no question that kids' intellectual development may have been impacted. We don't know how many thousands.  The idea that there has not been a dramatic response is beyond comprehension. And when you have one of the, I think, significant public health crises of recent years, of course the federal government comes in.  And of course the federal government says, you're not going to be poisoning little kids and impacting their entire lives.  Last point on this. And I suspect the secretary agrees. One wonders if this were a white suburban community what kind of response there would have been. [applause]  Flint, Michigan, is a poor community. It is disproportionately African-American and minority. And what has happened there is absolutely unacceptable.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	Absolutely right.  	True	False	5
SANDERS	"Chuck, I believe in trade, but I do not believe in unfettered free trade. I believe in fair trade which works for the middle class and working families of this country and not just large multinational corporations.  I was not only in opposition to NAFTA—and this is an area where the secretary and I have disagreements. I was not only in opposition to NAFTA, I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA because I understood—I don't think this is really rocket science.  We heard all of the people tell us how many great jobs would be created. I didn't believe that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is, it's to say to American workers, hey, you are now competing against people in Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage.  I don't want American workers to compete against people making 56 cents an hour. I don't want companies shutting down in America, throwing people out on the street, moving to China, and bringing their products back into this country.  So, do I believe in trade? Of course, I believe in trade. But the current trade agreements over the last 30 years were written by corporate America, for corporate America, resulted in the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs, 60,000 factories in America lost since 2001, millions of decent-paying jobs; and also a downward spiral, a race to the bottom where employers say, ""Hey, you don't want to take a cut in pay? We're going to China.""  Workers today are working longer hours for lower wages. Trade is one of the reasons for that. [applause]  "	True	False	5
SANDERS	No, let...  	True	False	5
SANDERS	"... I am absolutely supportive of comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows. All right? We got to do that. [applause]  But you miss—when you looked at the issues, you missed two of the most important. And that is you're not going to accomplish what has to be done for working families and the middle class unless there is campaign finance reform. [applause]  So long as big money interests control the United States Congress, it is gonna be very hard to do what has to be done for working families. So let me be very clear. No nominee of mine, if I'm elected president, to the United States Supreme Court will get that nomination unless he or she is loud and clear, and says they will vote to overturn Citizens United. [applause]  Second point—second point is that the only way we make change in terms of health care, in terms of dealing with a broken criminal justice system which, today, allows us to have more people in jail than any other country—largely African-American and Latino—the only way we create millions of jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure or have a tax system that says to the wealthy that they are going to pay their fair share, is when millions of people become involved in the political process.  No, you just can't negotiate with Mitch McConnell. Mitch is gonna have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying, ""Mitch, stop representing the billionaire class. Start listening to working families.""  And as president, that's what I will work hard on. [applause]  "	True	False	5
SANDERS	I agree with what the secretary said. We shouldn't be getting ahead of ourselves. And as I have said many times, you know, sometimes in these campaigns, things get a little bit out of hand. I happen to respect the secretary very much, I hope it's mutual. And on our worst days, I think it is fair to say we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate. [applause]  	True	False	5
SANDERS	I—my dad came to this country at the age of 17 from Poland. Didn't have any money, couldn't speak English, he died pretty young, and I think it would have been beyond his wildest dreams to see his son up here on this stage today running for president.  I love this country and my dad loved this country, and he was the most proud American because of what it gave him in terms of raising his family, even though we never had much money. But today in America, we are the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people, that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth. We are seeing millions of families unable to send their kids to college in the United States of America.  I'm running for president because I believe it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. I do believe we need a political revolution where millions of people stand up and say loudly and clearly that our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.  Thank you all. [applause]  	True	False	5
BROWNLEE	Hi, my name Marques Brownlee, and I've been making YouTube videos about electronics and gadgets for the past seven years.  I think America's future success is tied to getting all kinds of tech right. Tech companies are responsible for the encryption technology to protect personal data, but the government wants a back door into that information.  So do you think it's possible to find common ground? And where do you stand on privacy versus security?  [end video clip]  	True	False	4
CLINTON	Well, I'm happy to be here in New Hampshire for this debate, as we move toward the primary on Tuesday.  I believe that America has the opportunity to once again live by our values, live up to our values in the 21st century, but I think that America can only do that if Americans can succeed. And there are lots of reasons why Americans today are feeling left out and left behind.  Yes, of course, the economy has not been working for most Americans. Yes, of course, we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game.  But there's also the continuing challenges of racism, of sexism, of discrimination against the LGBT community, of the way that we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated.  I believe that we can get back on the right track. I want to imagine a country where people's wages reflect their hard work, where we have healthcare for everyone, and where every child gets to live up to his or her potential.  I'm fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes, and I'm not making promises that I cannot keep.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Well, let me start by saying that Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals. I've been fighting for universal healthcare for many years, and we're now on the path to achieving it. I don't want us to start over again. I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare.  I want to build on the progress we've made; got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage. And I don't want to rip away the security that people finally have; 18 million people now have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar. So we have a difference.  I also believe in affordable college, but I don't believe in free college, because every expert that I have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs. What I want to do is make sure middle class kids, not Donald Trump's kids, get to be able to afford college. I want to get the economy going again. It's not just enough about what we're against, as important as that is. I have a plan to create new jobs, manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power. I also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again.  And of course, I believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work. But the numbers just don't add up, from what Senator Sanders has been proposing. That's why all of the independent experts, all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable.  Let's go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do. A progressive is someone who makes progress. That's what I intend to do.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	If I could just follow up on that. [applause]  There is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care, the disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up.  The Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I want to improve it. I want to build on it, get the costs down, get prescription drug costs down. Senator Sanders wants us to start all over again. This was a major achievement of President Obama, of our country. It is helping people right now.  I am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding. Let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody. [applause]  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Well because I am a progressive who gets things done. And the root of that word, progressive, is progress. But I've heard Senator Sanders comments, and it's really caused me to wonder who's left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Under his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street; Vice President Biden is not progressive because she supported Keystone; Senator Shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact. Even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for DOMA.  You know, we have differences and, honestly, I think we should be talk about what we want to do for the country. But if we're going to get into labels, I don't think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times. [applause]  I don't think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity. I don't think it was progressive to vote against Ted Kennedy's immigration reform. So we could go back and forth like this, but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what we've done and what we will do. That's why I am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress, get more jobs with rising incomes, get us to universal health care coverage, get us to universal pre-k, paid family leave and the other elements of what I think will build a strong economy, that will ensure Americans keep making progress. That's what I'm offering and that's what I will do as president. [applause]  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Well, Chuck...  	True	False	5
CLINTON	... If I could, you know, in the very first debate I was asked am I a moderate or a progressive and I said I'm a progressive who likes to get things done. Cherry picking a quote here or there doesn't change my record of having fought for racial justice, having fought for kids rights, having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the Children's Defense Fund.  It certainly didn't stop me from taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies. Before it was called Hillarycare—I mean, before it was called ObamaCare it was called Hillarycare because we took them on, and we weren't successful, but we kept fighting and we got the children's health insurance program. Every step along the way I have stood up, and fought, and have the scars to prove it.  So, again...[applause]...I think it's important that, look, I understand Senator Sanders really trying to distinguish himself. I understand that, that's what you do in campaigns, but at the same time let's not be—in, I think an unfair way, making an accusation, or making an attack about where I stand and about where I've always stood.  It is fair to say, Senator, that in your definition, as you being the self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism, I don't know anyone else who fits that definition, but I know a lot of really hard fighting progressives in the Democratic party who have stood up time, and time again against special interests, against the powerful on behalf of those who are left behind and left out.  And, that's what we ought to be celebrating. Let's talk about what we would do as President, and Commander in Chief to make sure the progress continues into the future. [applause]  	True	False	5
CLINTON	... Well, you began it yesterday with your comments...  	True	False	5
CLINTON	You know, the person who first put out the idea of a 50-state party strategy is former Governor Howard Dean, who is with us tonight. [applause]  And I'm very proud and grateful to have the support of so many elected Vermonters and former officials. Two former governors, the current governor, the current other senator. I really appreciate that.  And I think it's because they've worked with me, they've seen what I do. They know what kind of a colleague I am. They want me as their partner in the White House. And that's exactly what I will do.  We'll get things done together. Democrats, Republicans, independents, we're going to make progress together when I'm president. [applause]  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Well, look, I've got to just jump in here because, honestly, Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment. And I've got to tell you that it is...[applause]...it is really quite amusing to me.  People support me because they know me. They know my life's work. They have worked with me and many have also worked with Senator Sanders. And at the end of the day they endorse me because they know I can get things done. [applause]  I am not going to make promises I can't keep. I am not going to talk about big ideas like single-payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost. A respected health economist said that these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year.  I'm not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes, and not mean it, because I don't want to see the kind of struggle that the middle class is going through exemplified by these promises that would raise taxes and make it much more difficult for many, many Americans to get ahead and stay ahead. That is not my agenda. [applause]  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Yeah, but I—I think it's fair to really ask what's behind that comment. You know, Senator Sanders has said he wants to run a positive campaign. I've tried to keep my disagreements over issues, as it should be.  But time and time again, by innuendo, by insinuation, there is this attack that he is putting forth, which really comes down to—you know, anybody who ever took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought.  And I just absolutely reject that, Senator. And I really don't think these kinds of attacks by insinuation are worthy of you. And enough is enough. If you've got something to say, say it directly.  But you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	And I have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities, and I'm very proud of that.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	So I think it's time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out...  	True	False	5
CLINTON	... in recent weeks, and let's talk...[booing]...let's talk about about the issues. Let's talk about the issues that divide us.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	And let's—let's...  	True	False	5
CLINTON	... we both agree with campaign finance reform.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	I—I worked hard for McCain-Feingold.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	I want to reverse Citizens United.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	And so—let's talk about issues.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Well, you know, Senator, I don't think—I don't...  [crosstalk] [applause]  	True	False	5
CLINTON	... I don't think you could find any person in political life today who has been subjected to more attacks and had more money spent against her by special interests, among whom you have named a few, than I.  And I'm proud of that. You know, when I took on the drug companies and the insurance companies for universal health care coverage, they went after me with a vengeance.  Today, you've got hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove, running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you. I know this game. I'm going to stop this game.  But while we're talking about votes, you're the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000, which contributed to the over-leveraging of Lehman Brothers, which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy.  So I don't know—I'm not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives. People make mistakes and I'm certainly not saying you did it for any kind of financial advantage. What we've got to do as Democrats—what we've got to do as Democrats is to be united to actually solve these problems. And what I believe is that I have a better track record and a better opportunity to actually get that job done.  That's what this election should be about. [applause]  	True	False	5
CLINTON	On the issue of Wall Street.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Well you know, Rachel, I think I may not have done the job I should in explaining my record. You know, I did—when I left the secretary of State's office, like so many former officials, military leaders, journalists, others, I did go on the speaking circuit. I spoke to heart doctors, I spoke to the American Camping Association, I spoke to auto dealers, and yes, I spoke to firms on Wall Street. They wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of State.  But what I want people to know is I went to Wall Street before the crash. I was the one saying you're going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages. I called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy. I proposed changes in CEO compensation.  I called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created. And I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people at least know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary. They have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads. Hedge fund billionaires, Karl Rove, another billionaire, jumped in.  And why are they doing that? These are guys who try to make smart investments. They know my record, they know me, they know that I say what I believe and I will do it. And I also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them.  So I do want people to know that, and I think it's important for everybody to understand I have a record, I have stood firm and I will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the economy again. [applause]  	True	False	5
CLINTON	If I could, let me just say that of course it has to change. It has to change. And that's why I have put forward a plan to do just that. And it's been judged to be the toughest, most effective and comprehensive one.  I have great respect for Senator Sanders's commitment to try to restore Glass-Steagall. But I do not believe that that is enough. And in fact, I don't believe it really addresses a lot of the biggest issues we have.  You know, we now have power under the Dodd-Frank legislation to break up banks. And I've said I will use that power if they pose a systemic risk. But I want to go further, because it was investment banks, it was insurance companies, it was mortgage companies, all of which contributed.  So let's not just be narrowly focused on one part of the problem. We have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed. My plan takes us further and it would do the job.  [crosstalk] [applause]  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Look we have a law—look, you know, I—I appreciate the senator's advocacy. We have a law. It was passed. It was signed by President Obama. It lays out a process that you go through to determine whether a systemic risk is posed.  And by the way, President Obama signed that, pushed it through, even though he took donations from Wall Street, because he's a responsible president. So we have a law in place. If the circumstances warrant it, I will certainly use it. And from what you say, I know you will as well.  But that is not enough. And I keep going back to this because part of the reason the Wall Street guys are trying so hard to stop me—the hedge fund guys, the shadow banking guys—is because I've got their number on all of that. And my plan goes so much further to try to prevent the problems of the future.  You know, we can't just fight the last war. We've got to be prepared to stop these guys if they ever try to use their economic power once again, to hurt the economy, and to hurt so many Americans. And my plan, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, a lot of experts who understand what the new challenges might be, have said I am exactly on point, and the Wall Street guys actually know that. [applause]  [crosstalk]  	True	False	5
CLINTON	I will look into it. I don't know the status, but I will certainly look into it. But, I can only repeat what is the fact that I spoke to a lot of different groups with a lot of different constituents, a lot of different kinds of members about issues that had to do with world affairs. I probably described more times than I can remember how stressful it was advising the President about going after Bin Laden.  My view on this is look at my record. Look at what I am proposing, and—we have a vigorous agreement here. We both want to reign in the excesses of Wall Street. I also want to reign in the excesses of Johnson Controls that we bailed out when they were an autoparts company, and we saved the auto industry, and now they want to avoid paying taxes.  I want to go after the pharmaceutical companies like Valeant, and Turns that are increasing prices without any regard to the impact on people's health. Now, if all we're going to talk about is one part of our economy, and indeed one streak in our economy, we're missing the big oil companies. We're missing other big energy companies. We're missing the big picture, and I have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist, and I will continue to do that.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	... Well, Senator, no one wants to see that happen. I mean, look, I care deeply about this because just like you I have met so many people who had their life savings wiped out, who lost their homes, who are barely back with their heads above water.  This was a disaster for our country, and we can never let that happen again. We have no disagreement about this. But, I think it's a broader target list than just Wall Street, and I believe that we have to be very focused on how we try to take back the power and increase the empowerment of the American people. And, I think I have that kind of experience, maybe because they've beat me up for so many years, and I know exactly how to handle them because I've been in the arena with them time and time again.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Well, I think what the president understands, and what he's trying to do, is that we have to support the Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground who are actually doing the fighting.  I agree with the president. I've said myself, we will not send American combat troops back to either Syria or Iraq—that is off the table.  But we do have special forces, we do have trainers, we do have the military personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the United States is leading so that we can try to take out ISIS infrastructure, take out their leadership.  And I think that, given the threat that ISIS poses to the region and beyond, as we have sadly seen in our own country, it is important to keep the Iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory, to work with the Sunni tribes in Anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed, to work with the Kurds to provide them the support, but they're doing the fighting. We're doing the support and enabling.  And I also think we've got to do more to stop foreign fighters, foreign funding and take ISIS on online, as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home.  So as I look at what the president it doing, it adds up to me. We just have to keep—try to get more support for those people on the ground in Syria and Iraq who have to actually physically take the territory back.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	No. I mean, of course that's a theoretical question, and we don't know what it would be for, and we don't know how many numbers there are. I am against American combat troops being in Syria and Iraq.  I support special forces. I support trainers. I support the air campaign. And I think we're making some progress. I want to continue to intensify that, and that's exactly what the president is doing.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	If I could—if I could...  	True	False	5
CLINTON	... respectfully add—look, we did differ. A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS. We have to look at the threats that we face right now...[applause]...and we have to be prepared to take them on and defeat them.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Oh, absolutely. The president decided to leave more troops than he had originally planned in Afghanistan. We have a very cooperative government there, with Ashraf Ghani and his top—his top partner, Abdullah. And they are doing their very best. And the Afghan army is actually fighting. The Afghan army is taking heavy losses defending Afghan territory.  And I would have to make an evaluation based on the circumstances at the time I took office as to how much help they continue to need. Because it's not just the Taliban. We now are seeing outposts of, you know, fighters claiming to be affiliated with ISIS.  So, we've got this arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia, and we have to pay close attention to it. And we have to build coalitions, something that I did to take on the Iranian nuclear program, and what I will do as president to make sure that we defeat these terrorist networks.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	A group of national security experts, military intelligence experts, issued a very concerning statement about Senator Sanders's views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues, such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try to resolve the conflict there; putting them right at the doorstep of Israel. Asking Saudi Arabia and Iran to work together, when they can't stand each other and are engaged in a proxy battle right at this moment. So I do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote, you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief. And there is no way to predict what comes in the door of that White House from day to day that can pose a threat to the United States or one of our friends and allies, and I think this is a big part of the job interview that we are all conducting with the voters here.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Well, let me just add that, you know, I've said this before and I'm very proud of it, that when it comes to judgment, having run a hard race against Senator Obama at the time, he turned to me to be secretary of State. And when it comes to the biggest counterterrorism issues that we faced in this administration, namely whether or not to go after bin Laden, I was at that table, I was exercising my judgment to advise the president on what to do, on that, on Iran, on Russia on China, on a whole raft of issues.  Because I know from my own experience that you've got to be ready on day one. There is just too much unpredictable threat and danger in the world today, you know, to try to just say wait, I'll get to that when I can. That is just not an acceptable approach.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Absolutely. You know, I did put together the coalition to impose sanctions. I actually started the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement, sending some much my closest aides to begin the conversations with the Iranians.  I'm very pleased we got that nuclear agreement. It puts a lid on the nuclear weapons program. We have to enforce it, there have to be consequences attached to it. But that is not our only problem with Iran. We have to figure out how to deal with Iran as the principal state sponsor of terrorism in the world.  They are destabilizing governments in the region. They continue to support Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon against Israel. A lot of work that we have do is going to be incredibly hard. I'm prepared to do that work, but I believe, just as I did with imposing the sanctions, you have to get action for action.  If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior. The president doesn't think we should. I certainly don't think we should. I believe we have to take this step by step to try to reign in Iranian aggression, their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Well Senator, let me just correct the record if I can. You know—let me correct the record.  [crosstalk]  	True	False	5
CLINTON	As I—as I certainly recall, the question was to meet with without conditions. And you're right, I was against that. I was against it then I would be against it now.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	"Part of diplomacy, the hard work of diplomacy is trying to extract whatever concessions you can get, and giving something the other side wants. Of course you've got to try to make peace with, and work with those who are your adversaries, but you don't just rush in, open the door, and say, ""Here I am. Let's talk and make a deal.""  That's not the way it works.  "	True	False	5
CLINTON	... Well, we set conditions on Iran. We worked hard to get them established, and to be enforced, and then we talked. That's exactly the right...[crosstalk]...and, that's what I did with the President, so he and I are on the very same page. [applause]  	True	False	5
CLINTON	I haven't talked to Secretary Carter, but here's what I would think he's planning. We do have the nuclear weapons agreement with Iran, that's an enforcement consequence, action for action, follow on. We have a plan, we will watch them, we will be vigilant.  We do have to worry about North Korea. They continue to develop their nuclear weapons capability, and they're working very hard on their ballistic missile capability.  And, I know that some of those plans could very well lead to a missile that might reach Hawaii, if not the West Coast. We do have to try to get the countries in the region to work with us to do everything we can to confine, and constrain them.  But, what Secretary Carter is looking at is the constant pressure that Russia's putting on our European allies. The way that Russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post-World War II Europe. The way that he is trying to set European countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in Crimea. Beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the Baltics.  We know that they are deeply engaged in supporting Assad because they want to have a place in the Middle East. They have a naval base, they have an air base in Syria. They want to hang on to that. I think what Secretary Carter is seeing, and I'm glad he is, is that we got to get NATO back working for the common defense. We've got to do more to support our partners in NATO, and we have to send a very clear message to Putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to. The best way to do that is to put more armor in, put more money from the Europeans in so they're actually contributing more to their own defense.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Well, first of all, I'm absolutely against privatizing the V.A. And I am going do everything I can to build on the reforms that Senator Sanders and others in Congress have passed to try to fix what's wrong with the V.A.  There are a lot of issues about wait times and services that have to be fixed because our veterans deserve nothing but the best.  But you're absolutely right, you know, Rachel, this is another part of the Koch brothers agenda. They've actually formed an organization to try to begin to convince Americans we should no longer have guaranteed health care, specialized care for our veterans.  I will fight that as hard as I can. I think there's where we can enlist the veterans service organizations, the veterans of America, because, yes, let's fix the V.A., but we will never let it be privatized, and that is a promise. [applause]  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Whatever they decide to do, that's fine.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	All right.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	I can only tell you what I believe, and that is that I am the strongest candidate to take it to the Republicans and win in November. [applause]  And I say that with great—with great respect for the campaign that Senator Sanders has been running. I personally am thrilled at the numbers of people, and particularly young people who are coming to support your campaign. I hope that I will be able to earn their support. They may not support me now, but I support them and we'll work together.  But what I'm concerned about is the views of many Democrats who know their states, who know how hard it is to win a general election. And it also will push whoever the nominee is into the spotlight. I've been vetted. There's hardly anything you don't know about me. And I think it's fair to say that whoever is in that position, Senator Sanders or anyone else who might have run, will face the most withering onslaught.  So, I think that I am the person who can do all aspects of the job. I think I'm the person best prepared to take the case to the Republicans. And I think that at the end of the day, it's not so much electability. It is who the American people can believe can keep them safe, can get the economy moving again, can get incomes rising, can build on the progressive accomplishments of President Obama.  And I think that the coalition that President Obama put together to win twice is a coalition that I can put together and add to. And that's what I'm prepared to... [applause]  [crosstalk]  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Absolutely I can. You know, before it was emails, it was Benghazi, and the Republicans were stirring up so much controversy about that. And I testified for 11 hours, answered their questions. They basically said yeah, didn't get her. We tried. That was all a political ploy.  Now, we had a development in the email matter today when it came out that Secretary Powell and close aides to Former Secretary Rice used private e-mail accounts. and now you have these people in the government who are doing the same thing to Secretary Powell and Secretary Rice's aide they've been doing to me, which is that I never sent or received any classified material. They are retroactively classifying it.  I agree completely with Secretary Powell, who said today this is an absurdity. And so I think the American people will know it's an absurdity. I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever. [applause]  	True	False	5
CLINTON	I am 100 percent confident. This is a security review that was requested. It is being carried out. It will be resolved. But I have to add if there's going to be a security review about me, there's going to have to be security reviews about a lot of other people, including Republican office holders, because we've got this absurd situation of retroactive classifications.  Honest to goodness, this is—this just beggars the imagination. So I have absolutely no concerns about it, but we've got to get to the bottom of what's really going on here, and I hope that will happen.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	No.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Yes, I do. And—you know, what I hope the Supreme Court will do is make it absolutely clear that any state that continues capital punishment either must meet the highest standards of evidentiary proof of effective assistance of counsel or they cannot continue it because that, to me, is the real dividing line.  I have much more confidence in the federal system, and I do reserve it for particularly heinous crimes in the federal system, like terrorism. I have strong feelings about that. I thought it was appropriate after a very thorough trial that Timothy McVeigh received the death penalty for blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, including 19 children in a daycare center.  I do for very limited, particularly heinous crimes believe it is an appropriate punishment, but I deeply disagree with the way that too many states are still implementing it. If it were possible to separate the federal from the state system by the Supreme Court, that would, I think, be an appropriate outcome.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, Rachel, you and I have talked about this before. I thank you for going to Flint to hold that town hall. I will be in Flint at the Mayor's invitation on Sunday to get an in depth briefing about what is, and is not happening.  This is an emergency. Everyday that goes by that these people, particularly the children, are not tested so we can know what steps must be taken to try to remediate the effects of the poisoning that they have been living with is a day lost in a child's life. I know from the work that I've done over so many years, lead, the toxic nature of lead can affect you brain development, your body development, your behavior.  I absolutely believe that what is being done is not sufficient. We need to be absolutely clear about everything that should be done from today to tomorrow, into the future to try to remedy the terrible burden that the people of Flint are barring. That includes fixing their pipes, it includes guaranteeing whatever healthcare and educational embellishments they may need going forward, and I think the federal government has way where it can bill the state of Michigan. If Michigan won't do it, there have to be ways that we can begin to move, and then make them pay for it, and hold them accountable. [applause]  	True	False	5
CLINTON	You know, Chuck, I've only had responsibility for voting for trade agreements as a senator. And I voted a multinational trade agreement when I was senator, the CAFTA agreement, because I did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of America, of our incomes, and I opposed it.  I did hope that the TPP, negotiated by this administration, would put to rest a lot of the concerns that many people have expressed about trade agreements. And I said that I was holding out that hope that it would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for.  I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration. Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it.  Now I have a very clear view about this. We have to trade with the rest of the world. We are 5 percent of the world's population. We have to trade with the other 95 percent. And trade has to be reciprocal. That's the way the global economy works.  But we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy. So it's not just what's in the trade agreement that I'm interested in.  I did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from President Bush with Korea. We go the UAW on board because of changes we made. So there are changes that I believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved, but I do not currently support it as it is written.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Well, I—I don't accept that premise, Chuck. I think that we've got so much business we have to do. We've talked a lot tonight about what we're against—we're against income inequality. We're against the abuses of powerful interests. We're against a lot of things.  I'm for a lot of things. I don't want to just stop bad things from happening, I want to start good things from happening. And I believe, if I'm so fortunate to get the nomination, I will begin to work immediately on putting together an agenda, beginning to talk with members of Congress and others about how we can push forward.  I want to have half a billion more solar panels deployed, the first four years. [applause]  I want to have enough clean energy to power every home the next four years. I want us to keep working on the Affordable Care Act, to get not only to 100 percent coverage, but bring down the costs of prescription drugs and out-of-pocket costs.  I want to move forward on paid family leave, on early childhood education, I want us to do more for small businesses. [applause]  Small businesses have to create most of the jobs, and we're not creating and growing small businesses. I think, if you have a smart agenda, you pick the committees that you know have to begin to work on these various pieces—because that's the way Congress is set up. You go through different committees, and you really make a big push in the beginning.  Immigration reform, economic revitalization with manufacturing, with infrastructure—we put it out there, and we begin to work on an ambitious, big, bold agenda that will actually produce the results that I want to see for our country.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	"The answer to both of those is no. I'm interested in making what we have work better. I want to streamline programs that are duplicative and redundant. I want to have a top-to-bottom review about what works and what doesn't work, and be absolutely clear we're getting rid of what doesn't work.  I have had the opportunity to run a big agency. I was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said I ran the State Department better—better than anybody had run it in a long time. So I have an idea of what it's going to take to make our government work more efficiently.  And when you put together a budget, you have to make a lot of hard decisions, but I think it's not appropriate to say ""I'm going to get rid of this, get rid of that"" until you have a very good process that gives you the information about what to do.  But I want to add something else, you know, because look, we have so much work to do in our country, and I think it's the greatest work that Americans will be called to do. And of course, we have to have people in every community involved in it. We have to have the political voice, the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in Washington.  But we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve, and we need to level with the American people about what they are, what they will cost, what will be expected of our citizenry. So I see as president having a constant dialogue with Americans here's what we're trying to get done, here's why I need your help, here's why you may think comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship isn't something you care about, but I'm telling you it will help fix the labor market, it will bring people out of the shadows—  "	True	False	5
CLINTON	—it will actually raise wages. You have to make all those connections so that you've got people with you every step of the way. That's what I want to do.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	I never said that.  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Look...  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Well, I'm certainly going to unite the party, but I'm not—I'm not getting ahead of myself. I think that would be a little bit presumptuous. If I'm so fortunate as to be the nominee, the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Senator Sanders. [applause]  	True	False	5
CLINTON	That's true. That's true.  [crosstalk]  	True	False	5
CLINTON	Well first, thanks to MSNBC and thanks to all of you for holding this debate before the New Hampshire primary. I am going to campaign as hard as I can between now and Tuesday to earn your votes in that primary, and I hear some talk that people are trying to decide do they vote with their heart, do they vote with their head, I'm asking you to bring both your heart and your head to vote with you on Tuesday because we have a lot of work that can only come because your heart is moved.  You know, we didn't get to talk about the continuing struggles that Americans face with racism, with sexism, with discrimination against the LGBT community, with new Americans, with people with disabilities. Yes, we have income inequality, we have other forms of inequality that we need to stand up against and absolutely diminish from our society.  So I have been moved by my heart ever since I was a young woman about the age of a lot of Senator Sanders' supporters worrying what I can do to make a difference for my country, and I will bring that heart with me, but I will also tell you we've got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real differences in their lives that will make them better for now and into the future. [applause]  	True	False	5
TRUMP	"I actually think I have the best temperament. I built a massive corporation. I employ thousands and thousands of people. I've gotten along with people for years and years, have tremendous relationships with many people, including politicians on both sides. And no matter how you cut it, when I — when I came out, I hit immigration, I hit it very hard. Everybody said, ""Oh, the temperament,"" because I talked about illegal immigration.  Now, everybody's coming to me, they're all trying to say, well, he's right, we have to come to him. I hit other things. I talked about Muslims. We have a problem. Nobody else wanted to mention the problem, I brought it up. I took a lot of heat. We have to have a temporary something, because there's something going on that's not good. And remember this, I'm the only one up here, when the war of Iraq — in Iraq, I was the one that said, ""Don't go, don't do it, you're going to destabilize the Middle East."" So, I'm not one with a trigger. I'm not one with a trigger. Other people up here, believe me, would be a lot faster.  But I'll build the mill arbitrary stronger, bigger, better than anybody up here, and nobody is going to mess with us. That, I can tell you. [applause]  "	False	True	8
TRUMP	Am I allowed to respond? I have to respond.  	False	True	8
TRUMP	First of all, I respect what Ted just said, but if you noticed, he didn't answer your question. And that's what's going to happen — OK. [applause]  That's what's going to happen with our enemies and the people we compete against. We're going to win with Trump. We're going to win. We don't win anymore. Our country doesn't win anymore. We're going to win with Trump. And people back down with Trump. And that's what I like and that's what the country is going to like. [applause]  	False	True	8
TRUMP	Well, let me say a couple of things. First of all, Marco said earlier on that President Obama knows exactly what he's doing, like we have this president that really knows. I disagree, respectfully, with Marco.  I think we have a president who, as a president, is totally incompetent, and he doesn't know what he's doing. [applause]  I think he has no idea what he's doing. And our country is going to hell. So, I just want to say, we disagree on that. Is that okay?  	False	True	8
TRUMP	Good.  	False	True	8
TRUMP	As to North Korea?  	False	True	8
TRUMP	We have — tremendous — has been just sucked out of our country by China. China says they don't have that good of control over North Korea. They have tremendous control. I deal with the Chinese all of the time. I do tremendous — the largest bank in the world is in one of my buildings in Manhattan.  I deal with them. They tell me. They have total, absolute control, practically, of North Korea. They are sucking trillions of dollars out of our country — they're rebuilding China with the money they take out of our country. I would get on with China, let China solve that problem. [bell rings]  They can do it quickly and surgically. That's what we should do with North Korea.  	False	True	8
TRUMP	Good evening.  	False	True	8
TRUMP	Yes.  	False	True	8
TRUMP	I don't think I am. I think I'm closer to common sense. We are going to repeal Obamacare. [applause]  We're going to repeal Obamacare. We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better. And there are so many examples of it. And I will tell you, part of the reason we have some people laughing, because you have insurance people that take care of everybody up here.  I am self-funded. The only one they're not taking care of is me. We have our lines around each state. The insurance companies are getting rich on Obamacare. The insurance companies are getting rich on health care and health services and everything having to do with health. We are going to end that.  We're going to take out the artificial boundaries, the artificial lines. We're going to get a plan where people compete, free enterprise. They compete. So much better. [applause]  In addition to that, you have the health care savings plans, which are excellent. What I do say is, there will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying and as a Republican, I don't want that to happen. We're going to take care of people that are dying on the street because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else and we're going to take care of those people.  And I think everybody on this stage would have to agree...[bell rings]...you're not going to let people die, sitting in the middle of a street in any city in this country. [applause]  	False	True	8
TRUMP	Well, let me just tell you about eminent domain because almost all of these people actually criticize it, but so many people have hit me with commercials and other things about eminent domain.  Eminent domain is an absolute necessity for a country, for our country. Without it, you wouldn't have roads, you wouldn't have hospitals, you wouldn't have anything. You wouldn't have schools, you wouldn't have bridges. You need eminent domain. And a lot of the big conservatives that tell me how conservative they are — I think I'm more than they are — they tell me, oh — well, they all want the Keystone Pipeline. The Keystone Pipeline, without eminent domain, it wouldn't go 10 feet, OK? You need eminent domain. And eminent domain is a good thing, not a bad thing.  And what a lot of people don't know because they were all saying, oh, you're going to take their property. When somebody — when eminent domain is used on somebody's property, that person gets a fortune. They get at least fair market value, and if they are smart, they'll get two or three times the value of their property. But without eminent domain, you don't have roads, highways, schools, bridges or anything.  So eminent domain — it's not that I love it, but eminent domain is absolutely — it's a necessity for a country. And certainly it's a necessity for our country.  	False	True	8

That's what — and by the way, let me just tell you, we needed tickets. You can't get them. You know who has the tickets for the — I'm talking about, to the television audience? Donors, special interests, the people that are putting up the money. [booing]  That's who it is. The RNC told us. We have all donors in the audience. And the reason they're not loving me...[booing]...the reason they're not — excuse me. The reason they're not loving me is, I don't want their money. I'm going to do the right thing for the American public. I don't want their money. I don't need their money. And I'm the only one up here that can say that.  Eminent domain, the Keystone pipeline — do you consider that a private job? Do you — do you consider that...  	False	True	8

TRUMP	Well, I think I am, and to me, I view the word conservative as a derivative I — of — of the word conserve. We want to converse our money. We want to conserve our wealth. We want to conserve. We want to be smart. We want to be smart where we go, where we spend, how we spend. We want to conserve our country. We want to save our country. And we have people that have no idea how to do that and they are not doing it, and it's a very important word and it's something I believe in very, very strongly.  	False	True	8
TRUMP	Well, before I go there, I will tell you, I will bring jobs back from China. I will bring jobs back from Japan. I will bring jobs back from Mexico, where New Hampshire, by the way, has been virtually wiped out. They've lost so many businesses going to Mexico because of horrible trade deals. And now we're about to sign another trade deal, TPP, which is going to be a disaster for this country because they don't talk about monetary manipulation. It is going to be a disaster.  I'm going to bring jobs back and I'll start bringing them back very fast. Under my tax plan — right now, we're the highest taxed country in the world. Under my plan, we cut not only taxes for the middle class, but we cut taxes for corporations. We will bring back trillions of dollars that's offshore. Right now, they have $2.5 trillion, and in my opinion, it's much more than that. That's what the government says. All of that money is going to come back.  And we're not going to lose Pfizer, which is now leaving, and other great companies, which is now leaving. And they're all leaving. We have many, many companies that are leaving this country. We're not going to lose them anymore because we're going to have a tax structure that is going to keep them in our country.  	False	True	8
TRUMP	"Well, four years ago, I said, bomb the oil and take the oil. And if we did that, they wouldn't have the wealth they have right now. Now, I still say the same thing, because we're doing little pinpricks. We're not even bombing — if somebody's driving a truck, they give notice to the person driving the truck, ""we're going to bomb."" If they don't get out of the truck, the truck sails away with the oil.  We actually have a case where we don't want to bomb the oil, because we don't want to hurt — pollute the atmosphere. Can you imagine General Douglas MacArthur or General Patton saying we can't bomb because we're gonna hurt the atmosphere?  You have to knock the hell out of the oil. You have to take the oil. And you have also back channels of banking. You have people that you think are our great allies, our friends, in the Middle East, that are paying tremendous numbers of — tremendous amounts of money to ISIS.  So we have to stop those circuits. Nobody knows banking better than I do. They have back circuits, back channels. Tremendous amounts of money is coming in through the banking system. So between the oil and the banking, you will dry them up. But it should have been done four years ago, not now.  "	False	True	8
TRUMP	You have to go in — first of all, when you take away their money, when you take away their wealth, that'll very much weaken — and it will happen fairly fast.  They'll last for about a year, based on all of the wealth they've accumulated. But when you stop the banking channels and when you stop the oil and take the oil — not just bomb it, take it — when you do that, it's going to dry up very quickly. They're going to become a very weakened power, quickly. Thank you.  	False	True	8
TRUMP	Well, I'll tell you what. In the Middle East, we have people chopping the heads off Christians, we have people chopping the heads off many other people. We have things that we have never seen before — as a group, we have never seen before, what's happening right now.  The medieval times — I mean, we studied medieval times — not since medieval times have people seen what's going on. I would bring back waterboarding and I'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding. [applause]  	False	True	8
TRUMP	... No, a good deal maker will make great deals, but we'll do it the way our founders thought it should be done. People get together, they make deals. Ronald Reagan did it with Tip O'Neil very successfully, you didn't hear so much about executive orders, if you heard about it at all. You have to be able to get a consensus.  Now, the real person like it was mentioned about the deal with Iran, how bad a deal is that? It doesn't get any more amateurish than that. A good deal maker would never make a deal like that. With Congress, you have to get everybody in a room, and you have to get them to agree. But, you have to get them to agree what you want, and that's part of being a deal maker. You can't leave the White House, go to Hawaii and play golf for three weeks and be a real deal maker. It doesn't work that way. You have to get people in, grab them, hug them, kiss them, and get the deal done. But, it's got to be the deal that you want. [applause]  	False	True	8
TRUMP	Some?  	False	True	8
TRUMP	The problem with executive authority for the president, it's really bad news for this reason. Since he's given up on working with Congress, he thinks he can impose anything he wants. He's not a king. He's a president. An executive order should be used frankly in consolidation and with consulting with the leadership in the — in the Congress.  I've done it in Ohio. I consult. I could use executive orders, but I don't trump the legislature, because if you do, you aggravate them, you anger them and then the long-term prospects get bleak. We have to solve problems in America by coming together, Republicans and Democrats, Americans first, party and ideology second — in the second back seat of this country. That's what we need to do. [applause]  And we can do it. And we can do it.  	False	True	8
TRUMP	Well...  	False	True	8
TRUMP	"Yes. OK, good. It looked like he was looking right at me, right there.  I think that — I look at what's going on, I look at all of the polls, I do very, very well against Hillary Clinton. I can tell you, I'm the last person that she wants to run against.  And I think you can see what we've done in terms of galvanizing. I've been all over the country. We're — last night, I was in South Carolina, we had 12,000 people. It set up in about four days. We have galvanized and we've created a movement. A lot of it has to do with — as an example, Josh's question on drugs.  I'm the first person that said, ""Build a wall."" But I mean, a real wall, not a toy wall like they have right now. A real wall. And you'll solve lots of problems.  But we will galvanize the people of this country, and we will beat Hillary Clinton. Because — assuming that she runs, by the way, how she gets away with the e-mail stuff is hard to believe. So, I don't know that she's going to be running. But on the assumption she runs... [applause]  I mean, look. And speaking of that, if she runs, she's running for one reason. She's going to be able to run for one reason, and that's because the Democrats are protecting her. Because so many people have done so much less than her, and they were absolutely — their lives have been destroyed.  But on the assumption they do protect her, I will win the election and we will win it by a lot. We will win it handily. We cannot have another four years of essentially Barack Obama. [applause]  "	False	True	8
TRUMP	Well, there is a divide, but I have to say that the police are absolutely mistreated and misunderstood, and if there is an incident, whether it's an incident done purposely — which is a horror, and you should really take very strong action — or if it is a mistake, it's on your news casts all night, all week, all month, and it never ends.  The police in this country have done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order, and they're afraid for their jobs, they're afraid of the mistreatment they get, and I'm telling you that not only, me speaking, minorities all over the country, they respect the police of this country and we have to give them more respect.  They can't act. They can't act. They're afraid for losing their pension, their job. They don't know what to do. And I deal with them all the time. We have to give great respect, far greater than we are right now, to our really fantastic police. [applause]  	False	True	8
TRUMP	Well, they do. And, you know, they sue. Everybody sues, right? They see excessive — I mean, they go out, they sue. We have so much litigation — I see the courts, I see what they're doing. They sue, and you know what? We don't want excessive force. But at what point — you know, either you're going to have a police force that can do its job...  I was just up in Manchester, I met with the police officers yesterday. Tremendous people. They love the area, they love the people, they love all the people. They want to do their job. And you're going to have abuse and you're going to have problems, and you've got to solve the problems and you have to weed out the problems. But the police in this country are absolutely amazing people.  	False	True	8
TRUMP	Well, I — I know Diane Foley very well. Her husband and — these are tremendous people. I spoke for them, I raised a lot of money for the foundation. I fully understand, James, one of — that was really the first that we saw, really visually saw — it was so horrible.  And I will tell you, though, with all of that being said, you can not negotiate this way with terrorists. If you do, you are going to have many, many more James Foleys.  James Foley was a great young man. His parents are incredible people. They've done such a good job, since his — since his death. But you just cannot negotiate that way with terrorists, or you're gonna have so many other James Foleys.  And one thing on the vets — during the last debate, I raised $6 million for the vets, and I will tell you something...[applause]...I will tell you that I think nobody here, nobody on this stage, gets along with the veterans groups in New Hampshire better than I do without ball (ph) to sarel (ph) and all of the people that I deal with and these are great people.  The one thing that we're not mentioning, there's tremendous fraud, waste and abuse in the Veterans Administration and if I'm running things, that's going to disappear...[bell rings]...and it's going to disappear quickly. [applause]  	False	True	8
TRUMP	Carolina.  	False	True	8
TRUMP	That's because he got Ben Carson's votes, by the way, but we won't [inaudible]. Our country that we love so much doesn't win anymore. We don't win with the military, we don't' win on the border. You look at New Hampshire with the tremendous problem we have with heroin. Number one thing I hear from the people of New Hampshire, who I love, and developed such relationships, we don't win with healthcare. We don't win with trade.  You look at what other countries are doing to us. China. Everyone, they're killing us on trade. If I'm elected president, we will win, and we will win, and we will win. Thank you, thank you very much. [applause]  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	What about Kasich? Can I introduce Kasich?  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	Sure. First, let's remember something. Every morning when a United States senator wakes up, they think about what kind of speech can I give or what kind of bill can I drop? Every morning, when I wake up, I think about what kind of problem do I need to solve for the people who actually elected me?  It's a different experience, it's a much different experience. And the fact is, Marco, you shouldn't compare yourself to Joe Biden and you shouldn't say that that's what we're doing. Here is exactly what we're doing.  You have not be involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable. You just simply haven't. [applause]  And the fact is — the fact when you talk about the Hezbollah Sanctions Act that you list as one of your accomplishments you just did, you weren't even there to vote for it. That's not leadership, that's truancy. [applause]  And the fact is that what we need to do — what we need to have in this country is not to make the same mistake we made eight years ago. The fact is it does matter when you have to make decisions and be held accountable for them. It does matter when the challenges don't come on a list of a piece of paper of what to vote yes or no every day, but when the problems come in from the people that you serve.  I like Marco Rubio, and he's a smart person and a good guy, but he simply does not have the experience to be president of the United States and make these decisions. We've watched it happen, everybody. For the last seven years, the people of New Hampshire are smart. Do not make the same mistake again.  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	Hold on one second.  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	Excuse me...  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	I think he mentioned me and my record in there, so I think I get a chance to respond. You see, everybody, I want the people at home to think about this. That's what Washington, D.C. Does. The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him. [applause]  See Marco — Marco, the thing is this. When you're president of the United States, when you're a governor of a state, the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesn't solve one problem for one person. They expect you to plow the snow. They expect you to get the schools open. And when the worst natural disaster in your state's history hits you, they expect you to rebuild their state, which is what I've done.  None of that stuff happens on the floor of the United States Senate. It's a fine job, I'm glad you ran for it, but it does not prepare you for president of the United States. [applause]  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	There it is. There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody.  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	You know what the shame is — you know what the shame is, Marco? The shame is that you would actually criticize somebody for showing up to work, plowing the streets, getting the trains running back on time when you've never been responsible for that in your entire life.  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	And the fact is, I went back, it got done and here's...  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	Oh, so — wait a second. Is that one of the skills you get as a United States senator ESP also? Because I don't think it is.  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	It gets very unruly when he gets off his talking points.  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	Let's get something...  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	No. Let's make something very clear. I learned seven years as a federal prosecutor in dealing with types of situations like we're talking about in North Korea, where criminals take people hostage. You never pay ransom to the criminals. Ever. You never pay ransom to the criminals. Everyone out at home watching tonight understands that principle.  And so, what you need to do is to engage in a much different way with these folks. They do not understand anything but toughness and strength, and we need to engage the Chinese to deal with the North Koreans, but we also need to make sure that they understand there's a commander-in-chief who will not pay ransom for any hostage.  This president and his former secretary of State are for paying ransom for hostages. When do that, you endanger even more Americans around the world to be the subject of this type of hostage taking and illegal detention. You need a strong commander-in-chief who will look these folks in the eye and say, we will not put up with this and we will take whatever actions we need to take, not only to get our people home safely, but to swiftly and surely punish those who believe they can violate the law and violate American's sovereign rights to travel the world freely and safely.  This is unacceptable. And this is why this president is so weak and why the secretary of State, who is embracing a third Barack Obama term, would be even weaker.  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	"Yeah, David, I would just like you to listen, again, everybody.  This is the difference between being a governor who actually has to be responsible for problems and not answering a question. The question was, ""Did he fight for his legislation?"" [applause]  It's abundantly clear that he didn't. It's abundantly clear that he didn't fight for the legislation.  When the teachers unions attacked me with $20 million of ads because I wanted to reform teacher tenure, I fought them and fought them and fought them and I won.  When they didn't want — when people wanted to raise taxes in my state at Democratic legislature and threatened to close down the government, I told them, fine. Close down the government. I'll get in my cars, head to the governor's mansion, order a pizza, open a beer and watch the Mets. You can call me when the government reopens.  And guess what they didn't do? They didn't pass a tax increase, because I vetoed it and they never closed the government because they knew I would fight for what I believed in. The fact of the matter is, a leader must fight for what they believe in. Not handicap it and say, well maybe since I can't win this one, I'll run. That's not what leadership is. [bell rings] That's what Congress is. [applause]  "	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	Good evening.  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	Well, he deserves credit for his record on jobs. He's done a very good job as governor of Ohio. Never said that John hasn't. He's done a very good job. [applause]  But — but unfortunately, John's been so busy doing over stuff, he's using old statistics. That's OK. New Jersey had its best year of job growth in the last 15 years under five different governors this year in New Jersey. New Jersey cut spending over $2.3 billion and we have 10,000 fewer employees than we had when I walked in the door. John has a bigger government now and more employees than he had when he walked in the door.  But all that doesn't matter. What really matters is this, that executive experience really matters. You heard this on the stage tonight. We've heard it said on the stage that President Obama knows exactly what he's doing.  I'd like to ask all the veterans listening out there tonight, who are waiting in line for healthcare, who are literally dying because the Veterans Administration doesn't work, do you think Barack Obama knows what he's doing? I don't. And I'll tell you something. Anybody who evaluates him is knowing what he's doing and managing the government doesn't know how to manage a government themselves.  And one last thing, David, which I think is really important. I listened to Senator Rubio's answer on his bill. He said his bill couldn't pass on the gang of eight. He acted as if he was somehow disembodied from the bill. It was his bill. He said this idea doesn't work. It was his idea.  See, when you're a governor, you have to take responsibility for these things. You can't just act as if it happened out of nowhere. We have to take responsibility as executives. I take responsibility for my record in New Jersey. We've rebuilt the economy and rebuilt after the second-worst natural disaster in American history. I'm proud of my record. And by the way, I like Kasich's record, too. He's a good governor. [applause]  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	David? Hey, David? David? Hey, David? I actually have experience with raising taxes on millionaires in my state. It was done. It was done by my predecessor.  And I want everybody in the public who is in that 68 percent, I want to tell you the truth. You're wrong. And here is why you're wrong. After New Jersey raised taxes on millionaires, we lost, in the next four years, $70 billion in wealth left our state.  It left our state to go where it would be treated more kindly. If the United States raised taxes any further, that money will leave the United States, as well. We won't have better jobs.  Let New Jersey be the canary in the coal mine. It is a failed idea and a failed policy, it's class warfare. It happened in my state. I've stopped it from happening again. But we cannot do it.  The 68 percent of the people are wrong about that, it will hurt the American economy. We tried it in New Jersey. Come take a look — it did not work. [applause]  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	Of course I would. As a former United States attorney who spent seven years of my life fighting this on the streets of my state, I would do that. But we need to do more. And let me tell you what we've done in New Jersey, Josh. We are working with the folks in New Hampshire in their legislature right now to show them how we're helping to solve this problem in New Jersey.  Not just for this campaign — three years ago, I proposed a law that we signed into effect, which said that anyone who was a non- violent, non-dealing, first-time drug offender no longer goes to prison in New Jersey. They go to mandatory, in-patient drug treatment.  What has happened is, crime has gone down 20 percent in those years. The prison population has gone down 10 percent. We've now closed the state prison — closed a state prison, and we're turning it into a drug rehabilitation facility, so people can get the tools they need.  Listen, everyone out there knows this in New Hampshire. This is a disease. It's not a moral failing, it's a disease. And we need to get people the treatment they need. And let me tell you why. Because I'm pro-life.  And I'm pro life not just for the nine months in the womb, I'm pro-life for when they get out and it's a lot more complicated. [applause]  Sixteen-year-old, heroin-addicted drug girl on the floor of the county lockup, I'm pro-life for her life. The 42-year-old lawyer who is taking Oxycontin and can't get out of bed and support his family — I'm pro-life for his life. Everyone of those lives is an individual gift from God.  And the last thing is this. These efforts we've taken over the last three years, 2015 in New Jersey, for the first time in four years, drug overdose deaths have gone down, not up.  I'll bring the same solutions to the country. [applause]  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	You bet I would. And the fact is that because I took strong action to make sure that anyone who was showing symptoms — remember what happened with that nurse. She was showing symptoms and coming back from a place that had the ebola virus active and she had been treating patients. This was not just some — like, we picked up her just for the heck of it, alright?  We did it because she was showing symptoms, and the fact is that's the way we should make these decision. You make these decisions based upon the symptoms, the medicine, and the law. We quarantined her, she turned out to test negative ultimately after 48 hours, and we released her back to the State of Maine.  But, I want to add something on the issue of mosques. Now, I'm the only one up here who's had a law enforcement background as a U.S. Attorney after September 11th. I went to mosques throughout my state to build bridges. To build bridges between our community in law enforcement so we can get intelligence and information from these folks.  I've had the experience of working with them as Governor of New Jersey as well. We cannot mix the radical Islamic jihadist with everyday Muslim-Americans. New Jersey is the second largest Muslim- American population in America, of any state. These are good, law abiding, hard working people. What they need is our cooperation, and our understanding. They do not just need broadsides against them because of the religious faith they practice.  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	Martha?  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	Can I — can I be really — can I be really clear on this, because I am the father of two daughters. One of them is here tonight. What my wife and I have taught our daughters right from the beginning, that their sense of self-worth, their sense of value, their sense of what they want to do with their life comes not from the outside, but comes from within. And if a young woman in this country wants to go and fight to defend their country, she should be permitted to do so.  Part of that also needs to be part of a greater effort in this country, and so there's no reason why one — young women should be discriminated against from registering for the selective service. The fact is, we need to be a party and a people that makes sure that our women in this country understand anything they can dream, anything that they want to aspire to, they can do. That's the way we raised our daughters and that's what we should aspire to as president for all of the women in our country. [applause]  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	Well, I've been pretty helpful to the pro-life cause in one of the most pro-choice states in the union. I've stood up for the first time and now for the last six years we've de-funded Planned Parenthood, not talked about it like they do in Washington D.C.  But for six years as governor, Planned Parenthood does not receive that funding from the state budget anymore; over $50 million worth of money that's been saved now, that is not going to do exactly what Hillary Clinton wants to have done and has advocated for.  She believes that organization, which engages in the systematic murder of children in the womb, in order to maximize the value of their body parts for sale on the open market, is an acceptable position.  Let me tell you something, I don't care if you are a millennial or whether you are in your 90s, no one is for that type of activity, unless you are the most radical type of extremist on this issue, like Senator Clinton and her party is on this issue.  I'll say one other thing. The fact is, that I believe that if a woman has been raped, that is a birth and a pregnancy that she should be able to terminate. If she is the victim of incest — this is not a woman's choice. This is a woman being violated.  And the fact is that we have always has believed, as has Ronald Reagan, that we have self-defense for women who have been raped and impregnated because of it, or the subject of incest and been impregnated for it.  That woman should not have to deliver that child if they believe that violation is now an act of self-defense by terminating that pregnancy.  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	Denver.  	False	True	8
CHRISTIE	Thank you. I've spent the last 13 years of my life focused on one thing: serving the people who have given me the opportunity to serve them. Not about politics, not about partisanship, but putting the people of my state and our country first.  I'm proud to have rebuild my state after Hurricane Sandy, and I'm incredibly proud to be on this stage tonight with these men asking for your vote.  New Hampshire, I spent 70 days here with you. You've gotten to know my heart. My heart is to help you solve the problems of your state...[bell rings]...and the problems of our nation. If you give me your vote on Tuesday I will do just that.

SANTELLI	Senator Cruz, let's focus on our central bank, the Federal Reserve. You've been a fierce critic of the Fed, arguing for more transparency. Where do you want to take that?  Do you want to get Congress involved in monetary policy, or is it time to slap the Fed back and downsize them completely? What are your thoughts? What do you believe?  	False	True	3
SANTELLI	Senator Paul, the same question to you.  	False	True	3
SANTELLI	Thank you, Senator.  (APPLAUSE)  Dr. Carson, you told The Des Moines Register that you don't like government subsidies, it interferes with the free market. But you've also said that you're in favor of taking oil subsidies and putting them towards ethanol processing.  Isn't that just swapping one subsidy for another, Doctor?  	False	True	3

CARSON	"Well, you know, when I wasn't introduced No. 2, as was the plan, I thought maybe he thought I already had dropped out. But... [applause]  But you know, today is the 105th anniversary, or — 105th birthday of Ronald Reagan. His 11 Commandment was not to speak ill of another Republican. So, I'm not going to use this opportunity to savage the reputation of Senator Cruz. [applause]  But I will say — I will say — I will say that I was very disappointed that members of his team thought so little of me that they thought that after having hundreds, if not thousands of volunteers and college students who sacrificed their time and were dedicated to the cause — one even died — to think that I would just walk away ten minutes before the caucus and say, ""Forget about you guys.""  I mean, who would do something like that? Now, I don't think anyone on this stage would do something like that. And to assume that someone would, what does that tell you? So, unfortunately, it did happen.  It gives us a very good example of certain types of Washington ethics. Washington ethics. Washington ethics basically says, if it's legal, you do what you need to do in order to win. That's not my ethics. My ethics is, you do what's right.  "	False	True	8
CARSON	Since I was mentioned...  	False	True	8
CARSON	This is great you guys. I want you all to mention me when you say something. [laughter]  In fact, the time line indicates that initial tweet from CNN was followed by another one within one minute that clarified that I was not dropping out. So, what happened to that one, it is unclear. But the bottom line is, we can see what happened, everybody can see what happened and you can make your own judgment.  	False	True	8
CARSON	Good evening.  	False	True	8
CARSON	Well, thank you. You know, I was hoping to get a chance to talk about North Korea. I was the only one who didn't get to do that, and I've got stuff to say about it, let me tell you.  But at any rate, you have to replace it with something that makes sense. It doesn't make sense. And the reason that I dislike Obamacare is because the government comes in and tells the people — which the nation is supposed to be centered on — that we don't care what you think, this is what we're doing. And if you don't like it, too bad. That's a problem. And we can't afford to do that because that will fundamentally change America.  I have proposed a health empowerment account system. Everybody gets a health empowerment account the day they are born, they keep it until they die. They can pass it on. We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional health care with, recognizing that we spend twice as much as many countries per capita and health care and don't have as such access.  We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account so that each family basically becomes its own insurance company without a middleman; that saves you a awful lot of money. And that will lower the cost of your catastrophic insurance tremendously, because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic health care.  And then in terms of taking care of the indigent, we have another whole system, and I can go ahead and explain it, but I don't have the time, but I'd be happy to if you give me some more time. But go to my website bencarson.com, read about it. You can read about everything that's been discussed here in great detail. [applause]  	False	True	8
CARSON	I want to say something about this, because I'm not here just to add beauty to the stage. [laughter]  You know, I've been talking about Libya for quite a long time. I think I was the first one to start talking about it because I say we have to have a proactive foreign policy strategy. And of course, the next place that ISIS is going to attack to is Libya.  If you want to expand your caliphate and increase your influence, then you're going to go to a place that's strategically located. You go north, across the Mediterranean. You're into southern Europe. You go south, you're into Chad and Sudan and Niger. Not to mention the fact that you have much more oil than you do in Iraq. That's the kind of place that they're going to go to, therefore, we need to be thinking about how do we prevent them from tacking over there. They're already sending their fighters there, we need to be consulting with our military experts and asking them what do they need in order to prevent ISIS from being able to take over Libya. That's going to have enormous concede for us.  	False	True	8
CARSON	I would support the possibility of renewed airstrikes if in conjunction with our Joint Chiefs and our military people they felt that was an appropriate strategy.  The fact of the matter is none of us up here is a military expert, and we sometimes act like we are, but we're not. And if we actually sit down and talk with them and get them to understand our plan and their impression of what needs to be done, I think we're going to make a lot more progress.  	False	True	8
CARSON	It's the same question?  	False	True	8
CARSON	Yes. Well, first of all, I think it would be a pretty easy contrast, quite frankly, between myself and Hillary Clinton. In one case, you have someone who is known as a deceitful individual. An individual who at Benghazi, which I will never let go, quite frankly, because I think of those two men who went up there on the top of that compound with machine guns, firing away, allowing their colleagues to escape.  And I'm sure, in the back of their mind, they were just saying, if we can just hold on, help is on the way. But help was not on the way. When did we in the United States not send people to help our own people? You know, this is not who we are. [applause]  And — I would simply make it a referendum on honesty and integrity versus deceit and the Washington way.  	False	True	8
CARSON	Well, you know, it's not a simple issue, and now, you know, we've gotten evidence that there can been active viruses in other bodily fluids like saliva and urine. So, this is going to be, obviously, a big deal.  Do we quarantine people? If we have evidence that they are infected, and that there is evidence that that infection can spread by something that they're doing, yes. But, just willy-nilly going out and quarantining a bunch of people because they've been to Brazil, I don't believe that that's going to work. What we really need to be thinking about is how do we get this disease under control?  And this is where we need rapid response. We need a rapid response for ebola, we need rapid response for Zika, there will be other things that will come up. These are the kinds of things that the NIH, the CDC, can be very effective in. We need to give the the appropriate support for those kind of things.  	False	True	8
CARSON	Can I say something...  	False	True	8
CARSON	Something about the draft. Very quickly.  	False	True	8
CARSON	You know, 14 percent decrease in the number of people applying for voluntary military service, and I think part of it is because of the way that we treat our veterans. You know, we wouldn't be a free country if it wasn't for them, and we have 22 veterans per day committing suicide.  So, I think what we should do is have an external support system for people once they volunteer and it should follow them throughout their career, should follow them for three years, five years afterwards, a year before they get out, should be working on integrating them back into society, so that they quit on Friday and they start their new job. They should have health empowerment accounts that are subsidized so they can go to any medical facility and be taken care of. They can go to a V.A. if they want to.  But if we start taking care of our veterans the right way, we won't have to ever worry about a draft again. [applause]  	False	True	8
CARSON	With 100 percent certainly, I will predict the winner — it will either be Denver or Carolina.  	False	True	8
CARSON	For many months, the political class, pundits, the media, have tried to ignore or bury me. They say that politics is too complex, and too sleazy. You can't survive. Well, guess what? I'm still here, and I'm not going any place either.  And, I believe there is still a place in our country for faith, integrity, and common sense. Hundreds of thousands of you drafted me to run for president...[bell rings]... And, I am going to with the help of God, and you, once again place the American people at the pinnacle with the government there to serve it. [applause]  	False	True	8

You've had a big accomplishment in the Senate, an immigration bill providing a path to citizenship the conservatives in your party hate, and even you don't support anymore.

QUINTANILLA	OK.  	False	True	3
QUINTANILLA	Thank you very much.  (APPLAUSE) QUICK: Senator Rubio, you yourself have said that you've had issues. You have a lack of bookkeeping skills. You accidentally inter-mingled campaign money with your personal money. You faced (ph) foreclosure on a second home that you bought. And just last year, you liquidated a $68,000 retirement fund. That's something that cost you thousands of dollars in taxes and penalties.  In terms of all of that, it raises the question whether you have the maturity and wisdom to lead this $17 trillion economy. What do you say?  	False	True	3
QUINTANILLA	Dr. Carson, we know you as a physician, but we wanted to ask you about your involvement on some corporate boards, including Costco's.

Governor Hickenlooper is not a big fan of legalization, but he's said the people who used to be smoking it are still smoking it, they're just now paying taxes.  Given the budget pressures in Ohio, and other states, is this a revenue stream you'd like to have?  	False	True	3

QUINTANILLA	Governor Bush, daily fantasy sports has become a phenomenon in this country, will award billions of dollars in prize money this year. But to play you have to assess your odds, put money at risk, wait for an outcome that's out of your control.

QUINTANILLA	I had a feeling you were going to brag about that.  	False	True	3

COONEY	Thanks, John.  Candidates, we've already heard your answers on what you would do with Syrian refugees, but a crucial part of the immigration debate here at home is control of our own borders.  Republicans say the borders -- securing borders is a top priority. Democrats say they want to plan for comprehensive immigration reform. So, Governor O'Malley, are you willing to compromise on this particular issue to focus on border security first in favor of keeping the country safe?  O'MALLEY: Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.  In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago. The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is... [applause]  The truth of the matter is, net immigration from Mexico last year was zero. Fact check me. Go ahead. Check it out. But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy.  That's what our parents and grandparents always did. That's what we need to do as a nation.  Yes, we must protect our borders. But there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, many of whom have known no other country but the United States of America. Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty. It is not a barbed wire fence.  	True	False	2
COONEY	Thank you. Now, Secretary Clinton said you would go further than the President when it comes to taking executive action to implement immigration reforms. But the President's already facing legal trouble on this. We've seen it more just in the past week. Realistically, how could you go further with executive action?  	True	False	2
COONEY	Kathie.  	True	False	2
COONEY	Senator -- Senator Sanders, we've heard a lot about this, your offer -- you want to offer free tuition to public universities and colleges.  A couple of questions about this. 63 percent of those who enroll graduate.  First question, isn't this throwing a lot of money away if we're looking at a third of these people are not going to complete college?  	True	False	2
COONEY	Well, one of the things you want to do is to have the states pay for about a third of this $70 billion plan, correct?  	True	False	2
COONEY	There are 16 states that are running budget deficits right now. Where are are they expected to come up with this?  	True	False	2
COONEY	Governor O'Malley, jump in now.  O'MALLEY: Okay, thank you. I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.  I believe that actually affordable college, debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation. And, unlike my two distinguished colleagues on this stage, I actually made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.  I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach. I believe that the goal should be debt-free college. I believe that our Federal Government needs to do more on pell grants. States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government. 7 percent and 8 percent to go to college?  I mean, my dad went to college on a G.I. Bill after coming home from Japan, flying 33 missions. My daughters went to college on a mountain of bills.  We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives. It -- it doesn't need to be that way. We can have debt-free college in the United States.  	True	False	2
COONEY	All right, Nancy Cordes has a question.  	True	False	2
LOPEZ	Gracias, Anderson. Senator Sanders, in 2013, you voted for immigration reform. But in 2007, when Democrats controlled Congress and the Bush White House was onboard, you voted against it. Why should Latino voters trust you now when you left them at the altar at the moment when reform was very close?  	True	False	1
LOPEZ	Tom Harkin isn't running for president. You are.  	True	False	1
LOPEZ	Secretary Clinton — Secretary Clinton, Governor O'Malley wants to open up Obamacare to millions of undocumented immigrants and their children, including almost 90,000 people right here in Nevada. Do you?  	True	False	1
LOPEZ	Governor O'Malley?  O'MALLEY: Juan Carlos, I think what you've heard up here is some of the old thinking on immigration reform, and that's why it's gridlocked. We need to understand that our country is stronger in every generation by the arrival of new American immigrants. That is why I have put out a policy for comprehensive immigration reform, that is why I would go further than President Obama has on DACA, and DAPA.  I mean, we are a nation of immigrants, we are made stronger by immigrants. Do you think for a second that simply because somebody's standing in a broken que on naturalization they're not going to go to the hospital, and that care isn't going to fall on to our insurance rates? I am for a generous, compassionate America that says we're all in this together. We need comprehensive  	True	False	1
LOPEZ	Senator Webb, do you support the undocumented immigrants getting Obamacare?  	True	False	1
LOPEZ	...Thank you, Senator.  	True	False	1
LOPEZ	Thank you, Anderson.  Senator Sanders, right here in Nevada, there will be a measure to legalize recreational marijuana on the 2016 ballot. You've said you smoked marijuana twice; it didn't quite work for you. If you were a Nevada resident, how would you vote?  	True	False	1
LOPEZ	Secretary Clinton, you told Christiane Amanpour you didn't smoke pot when you were young, and you're not going to start now. [laughter]  When asked about legalizing recreational marijuana, you told her let's wait and see how it plays out in Colorado and Washington. It's been more than a year since you've said that. Are you ready to take a position tonight?  	True	False	1
DICKERSON	Before we start the debate here are the rules. The candidates have one minute to respond to our questions and 30 seconds to respond to our follow-up. Any candidate who is attacked by another candidate gets 30 seconds for rebuttal. Here's how we'll keep time, after a question is asked the green light goes on. When there are 15 seconds left the candidate gets a yellow warning light.  And when time's up the light turns red. That means stop talking. [laughter] Those are the rules. So let's get started. You will each have one minute for an opening statement to share your thoughts about the attacks in your Paris and lay out your visions for America. First, Senator Sanders.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	All right, Senator Sanders.  Secretary Clinton.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Governor O'Malley.  O'MALLEY: My heart, like all of us in this room, John, and all the people across our country, my hearts go out to the people of France in this moment of loss. Parents, and sons, and daughters and family members, and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them, we must remember this, that this isn't the new face of conflict and warfare, not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century.  And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation. We must able to work collaboratively with others. We must anticipate these threats before they happen. This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.  As a former mayor and a former governor, there was never a single day, John, when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country. We have a lot of work to do, to better prepare our nation and to better lead this world into this new century.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	"All right, thank you, Governor. Thank all of you.  The terror attacks last night underscore biggest challenge facing the next president of the United States. At a time of crisis, the country and the world look to the president for leadership and for answers.  So, Secretary Clinton, I'd like to start with you. Hours before the attacks, President Obama said, ""I don't think ISIS is gaining strength."" Seventy-two percent of Americans think the fight against ISIS is going badly. Won't the legacy of this administration, which is-- which you were a part of, won't that legacy be that it underestimated the threat from ISIS?  "	True	False	2
DICKERSON	"But as -- Secretary Clinton, the question was about, was ISIS underestimated? And I'll just add, the president referred to ISIS as the JVU (sic), in a speech at the Council of Foreign Relations in June of 2014 said, ""I could not have predicted the extent to which ISIS could be effective in seizing cities in Iraq.""  So you've got prescriptions for the future, but how do we even those prescript prescriptions are any good if you missed it in the past?  "	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Okay, Governor O'Malley, would you critique the administration's response to ISIS. If the United States doesn't lead, who leads?  O'MALLEY: John, I would disagree with Secretary Clinton respectfully on this score.  This actually is America's fight. It cannot solely be America's fight.  America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies. America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world. And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.  ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner. ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France. And we do have a role in this. Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.  The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground. Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple. Our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope. Make ourselves stronger at home, but also our role in the world, yes, is also to confront evil when it rises. We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Senator Sanders, you said you want to rid the planet of ISIS. In the previous debate you said the greatest threat to national security was climate change. Do you still believe that?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Quickly, just let me ask you a follow-up on that, Senator Sanders.  When you say the disastrous vote on Iraq, let's just be clear about what you're saying. You're saying Secretary Clinton, who was then Senator Clinton, voted for the Iraq war. And are you making a direct link between her vote for that or and what's happening now for ISIS. Just so everybody...  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Alright. Let's let Secretary Clinton respond to that.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Senator Sanders let me just follow this line of thinking. You criticized then, Senator Clinton's vote.  Do you have anything to criticize in the way she performed as Secretary of State?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Alright.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Senator let me...  O'MALLEY: John, may I -- may I interject here? Secretary Clinton also said we -- it was not just the invasion of Iraq which Secretary Clinton voted for and has since said was a big mistake -- and, indeed, it was.  But it was also the cascading effects that followed that. It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS. It was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up.  We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict. It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator. It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	All right, Secretary Clinton.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	I understand. Quickly, Senator.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Secretary Clinton.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Let me ask you, Secretary Clinton, a question about leadership.  We're talking about what role does America take?  Let me ask you about Libya. So Libya is a country in which ISIS has taken hold in part because of the chaos after Muammar Gaddafi. That was an operation you championed. President Obama says this is the lesson he took from that operation. In an interview he said, the lesson was, do we have an answer for the day after? Wasn't that suppose to be one of the lessons that we learned after the Iraq war? And how did you get it wrong with Libya if the key lesson of the Iraq war is have a plan for after?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Governor O' Malley I want to ask you a question and you can add whatever you'd like to. But let me ask you, is the world too dangerous a place for a governor who has no foreign policy experience?  O'MALLEY: John, the world is a very dangerous place, but the world is not too dangerous of a place for the United States of America, provided we act according to our principles, provided we act intelligently. I mean, let's talk about this arc of instability that Secretary Clinton talked about.  Libya is now a mess. Syria is a mess. Iraq is a mess. Afghanistan is a mess. As Americans, we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet, but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies, to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability.  And I wanted to add one other thing, John, and I think it's important for all of us on this stage. I was in Burlington, Iowa. And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'. Let's don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.  My son is not a pair of boots on the ground. These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development, diplomacy, and our economic power in alignment with our principles.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Secretary Clinton, you mentioned radical jihadists. Marco Rubio, also running for president, said that this attack showed and the attack in Paris showed that we are at war with radical Islam. Do you agree with that characterization, radical Islam?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Just to interrupt. He didn't say all Muslims. He just said radical Islam. Is that a phrase you don't...  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	"The reason I ask is you gave a speech at Georgetown University in which you said, that it was important to show, quote, ""respect, even for one's enemies. Trying to understand and in so far as psychologically possible, empathize with their perspective and point of view."" Can you explain what that means in the context of this kind of barbarism?  "	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Just quickly, do either of you, radical Islam, do either of you use that phrase?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Governor O' Malley, you have been making the case when you talk about lack of forward vision, you're essentially saying that Secretary Clinton lacks that vision and this critique matches up with this discussion of language. The critique is that the softness of language betrays a softness of approach. So if this language -- if you don't call it by what it is, how can your approach be effective to the cause? that's the critique.  O'MALLEY: I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis. That's calling it what it is. But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here. They are our first line of defense.  And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion. And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Secretary Clinton, the French president has called this attack an act of war.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	A couple of days ago you were asked if you would declare war on ISIS and you said no. What would you say now?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	And you think that covers all of this?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	If you were in the Senate, would you be okay with the commander in chief doing that without it coming back to you?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Senator, let me just -- let's add to whatever you've got to say. Refugees. You've been a little vague on what you would do about the Syrian refugees. What's your view on them now?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Governor O'Malley, you have a magic number. I think it's 65,000. Does that number go up or down based on what happened yesterday?  O'MALLEY: John, I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65,000 Syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of ISIL, and I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening. But accommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6.5 more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000.  There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike. But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says. The nature of warfare has changed. This is not a conflict where we send in the third divisions of Marines. This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Just very quickly, 65,000, the number stays?  O'MALLEY: That's what I understand is the request from the international...  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	But for you, what would you want?  O'MALLEY: I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Secretary Clinton, let me ask you a question from twitter which has come in and this is a question on this issue of refugees. The question is, with the U.S. preparing to absorb Syrian refugees, how do you propose we screen those coming in to keep citizens safe?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Alright. Senator Sanders, I'm sorry. We're going to have to take a break now. We will have more of the Democratic debate here from Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. [applause]  [commercial break]  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Want to turn now from terrorism to another important issue for many Americans, the financial squeeze on the the middle class. For that, we go to my CBS News Colleague, Nancy Cordes.  Nancy?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	All right, I am sorry, Governor, we're going to have to go, I apologize.  O'MALLEY: Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs, so whenever we come...  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Governor -- Governor, you're breaking the rules. [laughter]  I'm sorry, we're going to have to cut for a commercial. We'll be right back here from Drake University here in Des Moines, Iowa.  O'MALLEY: Thank you.  [commercial break]  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	There is a lot of presidential history here in Iowa. It hosted the first in the nation caucuses. Herbert Hoover was born in West Branch, and tonight, we are in Polk County, named for our 11th president, with three people who hope to be number 45.  Joining my now to question them are Iowans Kevin Cooney of KCCI and Kathie Obradovich, of the Des Moines Register.  Kevin?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	You have -- you have given me the perfect segue. We are going to talk about Wall Street, but now we've got to go do a commercial.  We're coming to the end of the first hour. But there's another hour behind it and we're going to talk about Wall Street so hang with us.  [commercial break]  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	"Good evening again, as we begin the second half of the debate. Joining me in the questioning are the candidates -- of the candidates are CBS news congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes, Kevin Cooney of CBS Des Moines affiliate KCCI, and Kathie Obradovich of the Des Moines register.  As those who watched the first hour know, our topic is Wall Street. For those just joining us, welcome. Senator -- excuse me, Secretary Clinton, I went to the past there for a moment. Senator Sanders recently said, quote, ""People should be suspect of candidates who receive large sums of money from Wall Street and then go out and say 'Trust me. I'm going to really regulate wall street'.  So you've received millions of dollars in contributions and speaking fees from from Wall Street companies. How do you convince voters that you are going to level the playing field when you're indebted to some of its biggest players?  "	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Senator Sanders you said that the donations to Secretary Clinton are compromising. So what did you think of her answer?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Great follow up because you -- and Secretary Clinton, you will get a chance to respond.  You said they know what they're going to get. What are they going to get?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Hold on. He was attacked. [applause]  O'MALLEY: John, John,  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Hold on, he was attacked. Glass-Steagall...  [crosstalk]  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	All right. Senator, we have to get Governor O' Malley in.  Governor, along with your answer, how many Wall Street veterans would you have in your administration?  O'MALLEY: Well, I'll tell you what, I've said this before. I don't -- I believe that we actually need some new economic thinking in the White House. And I would not have Robert Rubin or Larry Summers, with all due respect, Secretary Clinton, to you and to them, back on my council of economic advisers.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	"Anyone from Wall Street?  O'MALLEY: They are the architects. Sure, we'll have an inclusive group but I won't be taking my orders from Wall Street. And look, let me say this. I put out a proposal. I was on the front lines when people lost their homes, when people lost their jobs. I was on the front lines as a governor fighting against -- fighting that battle.  Our economy was wrecked by the big banks of Wall Street. And Secretary Clinton, when you put out your proposal on Wall Street, it was greeted by many as, quote, unquote, ""Weak tea"". It is weak tea. It is not what the people expect of our country.  We expect that our president will protect the main street economy from excesses on Wall Street. And that's why Bernie's right. We need to reinstate a modern version of Glass-Steagall and we should have done it already. [applause]  "	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Hold on.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	All right, I want to switch to the -- switch to the issue of guns here.  Secretary Clinton, you said that Senator Sanders is not tough enough on guns, but basically he now supports roughly the same things you do. So can tell us what the exact difference is going forward between the two of you on the issue of gun control?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Secretary Clinton, I want to...  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Secretary Clinton, just a quick follow-up. You say that Senator Sanders took a vote that -- on immunity that you don't like. So if he can be tattooed by a single vote and that ruins all future opinions by him on this issue, why then isn't he right when he says your wrong vote on Iraq tattoos you forever in your judgment?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	But was that a mistake, Senator?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Senator, a mistake or not, your immunity vote? Quickly, before I go to...  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	So not a mistake?  O'MALLEY: John, this is another one of those examples. Like we have a -- we have a lot of work to do and we're the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do.  In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.  But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this. When you ran in 2000, you said that we needed federal robust regulations. Then, in 2008, you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying that we don't need those regulations on the federal level and now you're coming back around here.  So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle. We got it done in my state by leading with principal and that's what we need to do as a party for comprehensive gun safety.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Hold on.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Sorry. I'm going to bring in Nancy Cordes with a question from twitter about this exchange.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Final word. Final word, Governor O'Malley, before we go to commercial.  O'MALLEY: John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets. That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton. That's crony capitalism. That's a wonderful business model. If you place bad bets, the taxpayers bail you out. But if you place good ones, you pocket it.  Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street. I am not the candidate of Wall Street...  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	We have to -- we have to go for a commercial, Senator. I'm sorry. We have to go for a commercial here. We'll be right back with the Democratic debate here in Des Moines, Iowa on CBS.  [commercial break]  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Back now in Des Moines with the candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination.  Senator Sanders, I want to start with you. Let's say you're elected president. Congratulations.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	You've said you'll have a revolution.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	But there's a conservative revolution going on in America right now. As John Boehner knows and as Democrats know, who have lost in state houses across the country.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Those conservatives are watching tonight and probably shaking their heads. So how do you deal with that part of the country? The revolution's already happening, but on the other side?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Senator, as a 30-second follow-up, we've heard already tonight this figure, 92 percent of support for background checks.  Let's look at that as an example. There was something 92 percent of the public was for. There had been these mass shootings. There was emotional support behind it.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Bipartisan support.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	The president, the full force of his office.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	It went nowhere. That's the model you're talking about. Nothing happened.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	A question from Kathie Obradovich.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Secretary Clinton, just one more question on the e- mail question.  For Democrats, there's an FBI investigation going on. Can you satisfy Democrats, who might worry about an another shoe dropping, that you and your staff have been totally truthful to them, and that another shoe is not going to drop?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Race relations is another issue everyone cares about, and we're going to switch to that now.  Governor O'Malley, let me ask you a question. The head of the FBI recently said it might be possible that some police forces are not enforcing the law, because they're worried about being caught on camera. The acting head of the drug enforcement administration said a similar thing.  Where are you on this question? And what would do you if you were president, and two top members of your administration were floating that idea?  O'MALLEY: John, I think the -- I think the call of your question is how can we improve both public safety in America and race relations in America, understanding how very intertwined both of those issues are in a very, very difficult and painful way for us as a people.  Look, the truth of the matter is that we should all feel a sense of responsibility as Americans to look for the things that actually work to save and redeem lives, and to do more of them, and to stop doing the things that don't.  For my part, that's what I have done in 15 years of experience as a mayor and as a governor. We restored voting rights to 52,000 people. We decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana.  I repealed the death penalty. And we also put in place a civilian review board. We reported openly discourtesy, and lethal force and brutality complaints.  This is something that -- and I put forward a new agenda for criminal justice reform that is informed by that experience. So as president, I would lead these efforts, and I would do so with more experience and probably the attendance at more grave sites than any of the three of us on this stage when it comes to urban crime, loss of lives.  And the truth is I have learned on a very daily basis that, yes, indeed, black lives matter.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	"All right, Governor... [applause]  Senator Sanders, one of your former colleagues, an African- American member of Congress, said to me recently that a young African- American man had asked him where to find hope in life. And he said, ""I just don't know what to tell him about being young and black in America today.""  What would you tell that young African-American man?  "	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Secretary Clinton, you told some Black Lives Matter activists recently that there's a difference between rhetoric in activism and what you were trying to do, was -- get laws passed that would help what they were pushing for.  But recently, at the University of Missouri, that activism was very, very effective. So would you suggest that kind of activism take place at other universities across the country?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	All right, over to Kevin Cooney.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Thirty seconds.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	I'm sorry, governor. We've got to take a break or the machine breaks down. You're watching the Democratic debate here on CBS. [applause]  [commercial break]  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	We begin the final segment of this debate with something none of you saw coming. Something quite unexpected. Soon after your inauguration, you will face a crisis. All presidents do. What crisis you have experienced in your life that suggests you've been testd and can face that inevitable challenge? Secretary Clinton, you first.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Governor O' Malley, what crisis proves that you're tested?  O'MALLEY: John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.  But I can tell you this. I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor, I learned certain disciplines which I believe are directly applicable to that very, very powerful and most important of all jobs in the United States, the president, whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country.  You learn that threats always change. You learn to create a security cabinet. You learn to create feedback mechanisms. You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with.  I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Senator Sanders what, experience would you draw on in a crisis?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	All right, Senator Sanders... [applause]  We've ended the evening on crisis, which underscores and reminds us again of what happened last night. Now, let's move to closing statements.  Governor O'Malley, you're first.  O'MALLEY: John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process.  If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign.  Go on to martinomalley.com. No hour is too short, no dollar too small. If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.  We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress, but it's going to require that we act as Americans, based on our principles, here at home, making an economy that works for all of us. And, also, acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration, and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners.  There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days. I need your help. Thank you very, very much. [applause]  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Secretary Clinton?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	Senator Sanders?  	True	False	2
DICKERSON	And the candidates are thanking each other for a good debate. Clinton, Sanders and O'Malley now two debates in the books, with four more to come.	True	False	2
